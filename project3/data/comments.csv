Sometimes it will only feel wet or damp when the source of the water damage is occurring such as when it rains or when your above neighbour uses their water for an extended period of time (washing/showering etc).

"Hello! I'm in the same position as you, still serving and just got started on investing! Just opened my CDP account and awaiting my brokerage account to get activated so i can get started, as i'm already eyeing a few stocks. For me, i didn't really specifically do anything. Instead, i just read up everything i could about investing and learnt from my friends+parents. Pertaining to your post, since you wanna go the 'easy' way (low risk, low return), maybe you can consider investing in an ETF? Just put some money in it each month, and by the power of compound interest, it can yield you some pretty amazing results 20-30 years down the road. But of course, this option will yield relatively lower returns than if you played individual stocks. But what you SHOULD do is definitely go and do your own research! This applies even if you are planning to do passive investing (i.e just put an amount of money in every month), as different brokers/banks charge different transaction fees, which can sneakily eat into your returns if you transact frequently.

"Just something to chew on: if you have sufficient liquid savings right now and aren't in dire need of cash, you should consider topping up your CPF OA or SA account! The first 50k in CPF has an additional 1% interest, so the total rates of 3.5% (OA) or 5% (SA) easily beats whatever you can get from STI ETF or roboadvisors. Plus, this is risk-free too. The major downside is that you won't have access to this cash until you start paying off your student/housing loan for OA, and until retirement age for SA. Hence, the caveats above. Edit: This tip is probably more applicable when you're working, but I just had to leave this here as CPF is a really underrated tool for those with no experience in investing.",1589346419,fqghim0,t3_giq3ox,1,singapore,131

"Some alternative advice more pertaining to mindset. Take your time to just digest it for now. There is no immediate rush to do anything with it. You have plenty of time. Don't feel obligated to make the 'best' use if it. The thing is, when money comes from a loved one's loss of life, it feels like spending it 'appropriately' is the only way to properly 'live up' to it. That's impossible. Nothing will ever be good enough so don't worry too much about it. Seriously. Even if you invest it in a magic beanstalk overnight and turn it into $100 million and give it to the exact right person who uses it to cure Covid19. So what? It won't feel enough so don't look at it as a void to fill. Also, putting perspective into the amount of $10k. It's an amount someone can make in year (fully, gainfully employed). It's also an amount that can tide someone unemployed over, for a year (many assumptions here with omission of rent, but you get my drift).Look at how soon you'll be in a stage of life where that'll be the case for you. Because once you hit that, the amount has less meaning for you. Even if you want to do something frivolous like buying a $10k watch. In big picture it doesn't matter if you spend the $10k you made and saved over the year, or the $10k that was in your bank the whole time from this payout. Thinking otherwise just induces some kind of spending paralysis on you for the rest of your life. I share this from personal experience, where I got incredibly lucky from an 'investment opportunity' that never should have worked out from a very young age, and although it's nowhere close to the same as obtaining it from a life payout, I've had the same feelings of trying to 'live up' to spending it wisely. It's sat in my bank (coming to 10 years) uninvested ever since and I've lived most of my life as if it never existed. I appreciate the sometimes overly frugal habits that I've developed because of it, but at some point I learnt money is money and significance of where it came from and what you do with it is only what you assign to it. And spending it like a normal human being or consumer, isn't as bad as what those FIRE movement min-maxers would tell you.",1589346032,fqggzpt,t3_giq3ox,1,singapore,410

"Advice to stop lying to colleagues and feeling scared while working. I was newly employed as full time on first April I tot this job was ideal for me since it was similar to what I have worked as an intern. Unfortunately I was quite wrong as there were many components to rmb. So my issue now is I have the tendency to say I have completed all the steps, and they found out I didn't everything which is quite serious (this has happened many times on different occasions). I feel very bad for them and annoyed at myself because I feel incompetent while continuously lying and could have messed up somewhere if they didn't check on me. Feels terribly bad today cuz my colleague sound quite angsty when I approach her. I wish I can be honest to them and myself but when being questioned I feel pressurized and hence lied my way through.. Additionally, I realize when I say I didn't do / not knowing those few steps vs when I lie, it still ended myself being reprimanded cuz they would blame me for not asking which is really suffocating. So how do I cope with this bad habit? Do I apologize to them? Do I just be thick skin and straight up say I didn't do and just get scolded as usual (could be better than lying I guess)?",1589344759,fqgf8uf,t3_gilizf,-1,singapore,232

"&gt; # Judge rejects plea by woman who allowed customer into salon for massage and masturbation &gt; SINGAPORE: A woman accused of allowing a customer into her salon for massage and masturbation during the ""circuit breaker"" period had her guilty plea rejected on Wednesday (May 13) after she could not stop crying in court. &gt; Jin Yin, 55, was set to plead guilty to charges related to an incident on Apr 10, when she allowed a 67-year-old man into her In-Style Beauty Salon opposite the State Courts on Apr 10. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; There, she allegedly provided massage and masturbation services to him for S$150. &gt; However, Jin repeatedly sobbed and wailed in court on Wednesday until District Judge Ong Hian Sun said he would have to reject her plea as he felt she was not in the right frame of mind to plead guilty. &gt; The judge had stood down the case twice for Jin to compose herself, but she continued sobbing despite the interpreter coaxing her. &gt; Several security officers were also consoling her in court. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; When Jin heard that the prosecution was asking for a S$21,000 fine, she dropped to her knees and began begging for mercy, kowtowing and saying she could not afford it. &gt; She said she had only S$3,000 left and a daughter in Beijing to raise. She also said that she committed the offences only because of the debts she incurred after her mother contracted cancer. &gt; Jin was told that she could serve a jail term in lieu of the fine if she could not pay it. &gt; She asked how long it would be, but the judge replied that he was not prepared to decide that at this stage of the proceeding. &gt; At this, Jin began wailing again, saying ""what about my daughter"" and was given a chair to sit down. &gt; The judge rejected her plea and adjourned the case to a pre-trial conference later this month. &gt; For not keeping her premises closed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations, she can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000 or both. &gt; For each charge of carrying out an unlicensed massage business and advertising it, she can be jailed for up to two years, fined a maximum S$10,000 or both. Jin also faces enhanced punishments as she was previously convicted of similar offences, her charge sheets stated. &gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589343816,fqgdxcg,t3_girth5,5,singapore,437

"I preemptively removed my wisdom teeth so they just check my teeth then I was done during the FFI. I don't know how the current covid situation has affected getting a wisdom teeth removal appointment but I'll just give you my suggestion. I suggest you get your teeth checked before the FFI as you might not be able to go through the entire wisdom teeth removal process before you ord. Had a few platoon mates missed the opportunity to remove their wisdom teeth as their FFI was too late. So they did not have enough time to make the relevant appointments to remove their teeth. To get your teeth checked before your FFI you can either make an appointment with a polyclinic (need to pay for initial appointment,not covered with 11B) or ask your S1 clerk to help you make an appointment with an in-camp medical center. I made an appointment with the polyclinic as the earliest medical center appointment was like 1 month later than the earliest polyclinic appointment. They will then check ur teeth and if they require removal they will refer you to a hospital for further check ups.",1589342565,fqgc2rd,t1_fqfy453,1,singapore,192

"This is ridiculous. do we no longer have any propensity for patience? Some people are brought up in an environment where such language is common and probably the lowest level of aggression. I don’t agree that it should’ve been used but was police action really necessary? His wife continued to work despite not being an essential worker (most likely because they cannot are POOR?) and he is a cleaner. Obviously it’s a sensitive time and the couple is probably facing financial trouble. Being told to go home (I agree that the Sade distancing enforcement officer has to do so), the wife must feel very stressed and the husband will feel protective and provoked. He didn’t execute any form of violence or intent to cause hurt right? So why involve police action? Why financially punish them? Could it not have been solved with dialogue first? Did they even try? Why call the police STRAIGHT AWAY? Is this how we treat the people in the lower end of our economy?

"Yeah the Botanic Gardens are hardly a natural setting though. You're talking about a bunch of large fishes trapped in small waterbodies, without much aquatic vegetation or hiding places. And koi have been selectively bred for centuries to be much more conspicuous compared to their wild counterparts. No wonder they're such easy targets. A wild fish-eating animal would have to be stupid to not take advantage of this opportunity. In the reservoirs and canals, the fishes have much more room to swim around and escape. Otters have to expend more energy hunting in these places, and after some time, the fishes become too dispersed and too challenging to catch, so the otters move on to another area in their territory. In the meantime, the fishes reproduce and replenish their numbers, so it's really unlikely that the otters will ever become so abundant that they wipe out their prey. Instead, the presence of predators like otters is a sign that the ecosystem is healthy enough to support the prey required for them to thrive.",1589341865,fqgb016,t1_fqdws0b,1,singapore,173

"Take this all with a grain of salt. I'm certainly not familiar enough with the cultural nuances, how much has carried over internationally, and how it may be changing with the new generations to know for sure, but it makes some sense at least on a surface level I had read some article a while back (which I can't seem to find) describing the role of Chinese/Confucian [guanxi \[wikipedia\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanx) in influencing how relationships are viewed. There's a heavy emphasis on reciprocal favors/services/obligation and standing, developing and maintaining a network of connections to call upon. It can shift the view of relationships, at least in part, from ""I like/dislike your company"" to ""I see what you can potentially do for/against me"". As a result, a high status person might court a low*er* status person with potential, but wouldn't care to befriend a *low* status person since both what they can ""contribute"" and the possibility of significantly rising in status is low. Similarly, the low status person will continue to be respectful of the high status person (or at least keep their head down) to avoid possible repercussions. Based on my very limited understanding, I think the philosophy has a noble end goal - a strong community support network, building and maintaining trust, helping others and asking for help. I can see how the the specific self/own-family focused means and incentives to get there - coupled with a strong sense of hierarchy and drive for tangible success - can sometimes lead to results that I don't personally agree with.",1589341788,fqgavrc,t1_fqg3r3w,2,singapore,257

She was outside Hougang Mall selling headscarves and waiting for a customer when she was told to leave. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; Her husband Abdul Halim Adi, 48, pleaded guilty to one charge of using abusive words on a safe distancing enforcement officer. &gt; The incident occurred at about 1pm on Apr 14 this year, during the ""circuit breaker"" period when most businesses were ordered to close and people were urged to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. &gt; The victim, a 32-year-old HDB officer deployed as a safe distancing enforcement officer, was carrying out his work when he saw Abdul Halim's wife outside Hougang Mall. &gt; She was waiting to hand a headscarf to a customer, and was carrying on a business outside her home when she was not an essential service provider, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; The officer walked towards the woman, but she left when she spotted him. &gt; The officer entered the mall and spotted the woman about 15 minutes later. He told her to go home, and she said she would do so. &gt; However, the woman instead went to look for her husband, who was at the basement level of the mall near a supermarket. &gt; She told Abdul Halim that the safe distancing officer had been following her and had told her to go home. &gt; At this point, the officer walked past the couple. Abdul Halim saw the officer and his pass, knowing that he was enforcing safe distancing measures. &gt; Displeased by the victim's directions to his wife, Abdul Halim hurled Hokkien vulgarities at him and said ""why did you harass my wife"". &gt; The victim did not engage the pair, instead walking away and calling the police immediately. &gt; There were about 10 to 15 passers-by at the time, with some stopping to watch. &gt; The prosecutor asked for a fine of at least S$3,500, noting that enforcement officers tasked with performing ""difficult jobs of patrolling and safeguarding public health in the COVID-19 circuit breaker period"" must be protected. &gt; ""That being said, while general deterrence is the operative sentencing principle, here, the outburst was short and impulsive, and the crowd was thin, even if it was unwarranted,"" said Ms Wong. &gt; She added that Abdul Halim did not have previous related convictions, and that there was no evidence of him continuing to be aggressive. &gt; The judge allowed Abdul Halim to pay his fine in instalments by mid-November. &gt; For using abusive words on a safe distancing officer carrying out his duty, he could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both. &gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589340880,fqg9h41,t3_gir364,3,singapore,534

"&gt; # Forum: Pet industry stands to benefit from a negative list of animals &gt; Deregulation of the pet industry in Singapore is needed for its immediate diversification and growth. &gt; A negative list of injurious, dangerous and invasive groups of animals should be created, and those that are not listed should be allowed. &gt; Many of the largest pet industries in the world work on the basis of such a negative list. &gt; The pet trade in Singapore is based on a positive list, whereby any species not listed is deemed illegal. &gt; Such a practice has been very damaging to an industry that is diverse and has unlimited potential. Entrepreneurial spirit is killed because for new pets to be legalised, proposals need to be submitted and many meetings have to be held. And if a species is legalised, this would benefit not only the entrepreneur who submitted the proposals, but also his competitors. &gt; The current legislation against certain groups of animals - such as insects, reptiles and most other cold-blooded animals - unfortunately hints at speciesism, whereby these groups of animals are considered unimportant. &gt; Ideal pet species in a high-density urban setting are those that can be contained on personal property, which lowers the risk of any disease spread to the community. &gt; Pets that do not disturb the peace in the community should be promoted. &gt; Dogs, cats and birds make up the majority of complaints due to noise or other forms of public disturbance such as scent marking. &gt; Cold-blooded animals including frogs or geckos are easily contained in enclosures, and are much better choices to be companion animals, as they are far less likely to spread severe diseases to humans compared with conventional warm-blooded pets. &gt; In choosing a pet, consideration should be given to minimise inconvenience to others living in close proximity. &gt; Ong Junkai --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589340757,fqg9a4p,t3_gir20d,1,singapore,320

"Great that you've decided to advocate for yourself and seek help! :) I suffered from anxiety disorder due to residua PTSD shortly after moving back to Singapore a couple of years ago from Europe (where mental health is very unstigmatised and there is a broad range of therapeutic services to choose from). Knowing that private practices here are incredibly expensive I thought it would be sensible to request a polyclinic referral to IMH, since they claim to offer talk therapy/counselling (which I what I was looking for anyway) for a fraction of the cost. It was a huge mistake. The service was incredibly indiscreet (yelling my name across the reception lobby?), brusque and frankly upsetting. Not gentle with the more vulnerable patients (those strapped to chairs and beds) at all. The therapist in question turned out to be a psychiatrist, who interrupted me after 10 minutes and asked if I needed more sleeping pills (???). She said the most important thing was to take meds and address the physical symptoms of anxiety first before going into the counselling part which unfortunately, I really disagree with. Meds can be incredibly helpful when it comes to treating mental health but I would never start a course without a doctor I trust and who doesn't already know my situation inside-out. As impractical as it sounds, I ended up Skypeing in with my former therapist from abroad simply because it felt like a safer environment for me. This was a couple of years ago. I'm much better now and no longer require therapy (yay!) and have been told of many affordable/pro bono/sliding scale services that have been popping up in SG since. I believe there was a pretty comprehensive list floating around on Instagram via [""@asha.n.co](mailto:""@asha.n.co)"" Most importantly, if you can afford to, know it's okay to shop around for a therapist until you find one you're most comfortable with! Apart from support, talk therapy is rightly supposed to challenge you (e.g. on your own patterns and biases), but anyone who belittles you or makes you second-guess yourself is a no -- no matter how affordable their services are. (Therapists who dispense advice like ""You should do or say this"" etc. are also frowned upon in most psychological circles.)

He was served with an SHN for the period from March 17 to 31. &gt; Instead of proceeding to his declared place of residence in Sembawang Drive, he took public transport to Marina Bay Sands where he worked as a security officer. &gt; After he left work on March 18, he took public transport to his company’s lodging at Dunlop Street where he shared a room with three co-workers. &gt; He also continued to commute to work daily between March 19 and 21. &gt; The Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) discovered his breach of SHN on March 21 when enforcement officers visited his declared place of residence in Sembawang Drive and found that he was not there. &gt; Azhar Bin Khamis &gt; Azhar arrived in Singapore from Batam, Indonesia, on March 26, 2020, and was served with an SHN for the period from March 26 to Apr. 9, 2020. &gt; Instead of proceeding to his declared place of residence in Tampines, he spent the night at his sister’s residence in Serangoon. &gt; He left his sister’s residence on March 27 and spent the next few days in public areas at Harbourfront. &gt; ICA enforcement officers visited his declared place of residence in Tampines on Apr. 5 and found that he was not there. He was discovered at the Singapore Cruise Centre later that day. &gt; Zahari Bin Samat &gt; Zahari arrived in Singapore from Batam, Indonesia, on Apr. 1, 2020 and was served with an SHN for the period from Apr. 1 to Apr. 15. &gt; He had proceeded to a rented address at North Bridge Road, which was not his declared place of accommodation at Ang Mo Kio. &gt; Zahari went to the ICA Building on Apr. 2 to inform an officer that he had provided an outdated address in his electronic health declaration and intended to update the address where he would serve his SHN. &gt; He was advised to return to his place of accommodation at North Bridge Road immediately. However, on Apr. 8, he left his place of accommodation again and was arrested by CNB officers at an open air carpark nearby. &gt; ICA has investigated the breaches &gt; ICA has investigated these three individuals’ wilful breaches of SHN requirements. &gt; Quresh will be charged under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act, while Azhar and Zahari will be charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 – Stay Orders) Regulations 2020. &gt; A person convicted of an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act and its Regulations is liable to a fine of up to S$10,000, or up to six months’ imprisonment, or both. &gt; SHN requirements &gt; With effect from March 16, 2020, 11:59pm, all residents, Long-Term Pass (LTP) holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore with travel history to any ASEAN country within the previous 14 days would be issued an SHN and must remain in their place of residence at all times for a 14-day period. &gt; From March 20, 2020, 11:59pm, these requirements were extended to all residents, LTP holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore. &gt; Further measures were put in place from Apr. 9 requiring all residents, LTP holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore to serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated facilities. &gt; Top photo via Google Maps, MBS/FB --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589338229,fqg57e0,t3_giqeot,2,singapore,646

"&gt; # M1 fibre broadband outage hits thousands of users &gt; Thousands of M1 fibre broadband users around Singapore were left without Internet access for more than 17 hours yesterday during a time when subscribers need to work and study from home amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. &gt; M1's disruption, which comes one month after StarHub's intermittent outage, was still not resolved as of 10pm yesterday. &gt; According to the Downdetector website, which logs Internet outages, M1 started having problems around 4.30am, before complaints spiked at 9am with around 1,500 reports. &gt; On its Facebook page, M1 first reported the problem at 8am, noting that customers in some areas in the western, central and eastern parts of Singapore were affected, and that its engineers were working hard to resolve the issue. &gt; Many netizens said that northern Singapore was affected as well. &gt; In an update at 7.30pm, M1 said its engineers had identified and isolated the issue causing disruptions to the affected group of customers. &gt; It did not say what the issue was. &gt; Accounts officer Carol Tan, who lives in Jurong West Street 61, was still waiting for her fibre broadband connection to resume more than four hours after it first stopped working at about 7.45am. &gt; ""It's quite hard for us without broadband as we are all heavy (Internet) users. My husband and I are deaf, and we rely on the Internet a lot to update ourselves on what's happening outside,"" said the 45-year-old, who has two teenage children. &gt; ""My son also has an online class soon and we will have to see what happens."" &gt; Life coach Joseph Kalai, 45, noticed his broadband connection speed slowing to less than 100Mbps - a tenth of the 1Gbps he pays for - on Monday. &gt; ""I still had a connection but I read about the situation (yesterday) and for some reason decided to restart my router around 11am. Since then, no Internet,"" said Mr Kalai, who lives in the east. &gt; ""I think there was already some issue since Monday but no one picked up on it."" &gt; Mr Lim Jing Hong, who works in financial services, told The Straits Times that he normally starts work around 7am and could not get his connection to work at 6.55am. &gt; The 32-year-old, who lives in Marsiling, said: ""I could not verify if it was my router, personal connection, or M1's connection that was having problems... &gt; ""I only verified after getting through the hotline more than 30 minutes later. &gt; ""I thought communication (from the telco) was severely lacking. I missed morning meetings today, (and) had to arrange for other colleagues to cover my duties."" &gt; Last month, two network service disruptions on the same day affected thousands of StarHub subscribers, and were attributed to network equipment failure and a domain name server issue. &gt; Addressing the issue of network capacity in Parliament last week, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran said Internet usage in Singapore remains well within network operators' capacity despite a spike in traffic during the circuit breaker period. --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589338227,fqg578u,t3_giqejn,1,singapore,522

Otherwise, going for public options like restructured general hospital is the best. IMH used to be for ""everyone"" but now it seems to be populated with too many serious cases, and all serious cases which restructured general hospital can't/don't handle, goes there. I checked with the psychiatrist at my previous review, and there are indeed ward options for mental patients in the hospital. So no need to go to IMH or think of IMH as the only choice. Imo, given my personal experience... I would say that IMH only go if you are at serious risk of immediate self harm or a public risk. Until then, let the GP, polyclinic or the psych ward at restructure hospitals evaluate you first. It will be a far better experience, and you will actually get more help. Instead of being locked up for your own safety, cause they don't know what to do (That's IMH)",1589337814,fqg4iwj,t3_gi3st5,2,singapore,251

"I've worked in the service line and I can say this goes both ways... It goes both ways really, what gets measured gets done. There is an incentive to be nice to customers; they'll come back , and they won't complain about your shitty attitude. On the flip side, delivery people are essentially self-employed. There isn't a metric on how they should be treated and how good/bad treatment of delivery riders will provide any kind of tangible incentive. Considering they'll see many different faces of delivery riders, many times a day, some new some old, it really doesn't pay to be extra nice. The whole situation played out for me during a mother's day collection of food. The grabfood application apparently can't be switched off, so it rang consistently. The tzechar stall's kitchen was infuriated because they simply couldn't rush the orders, while the delivery riders were constantly asking if their order is done. It's an entire fault with the system where the rider is at a disadvantage because there's no point in either side (restaurant or grab) being ""nice"" to the riders. They're ""self-employed"" under this platform, getting paid probably better than any available jobs to them, and there's a huge ready supply of riders.",1589333163,fqfwn2e,t3_gigsv3,2,singapore,206

"&gt; # COVID-19: Singapore records 3rd straight day of single-digit community cases &gt; SINGAPORE: New COVID-19 cases in the community remained in the single digits for the third consecutive day on Tuesday (May 12), the first time since Singapore entered its “circuit breaker” period. &gt; Four community cases were reported on Tuesday, comprising three Singaporeans and one work pass holder. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; There were three community cases on Monday, and four on Sunday. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore implemented a slew of circuit breaker measures from Apr 7 to curb the spread of COVID-19, including closing most non-essential workplaces and moving schools to full home-based learning. &gt; Additional social distancing measures were also set in place for services that were allowed to remain open, including food and beverage outlets and supermarkets. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; The circuit breaker period was originally scheduled to end on May 4, but has since been extended to Jun 1. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The authorities also made it mandatory on Apr 14 for residents to wear masks outside of their homes. &gt; Several people have been fined for breaching safe distancing rules and not wearing a mask in public. &gt; REDUCING COMMUNITY INFECTIONS &gt; Singapore's circuit breaker restrictions have “shown promise” in reducing COVID-19 infections in the community, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in a multi-ministry task force press conference on Tuesday. &gt; The average number of daily community cases has fallen from 30 cases in late-April to eight in the past week, said Mr Gan. &gt; However, he also cautioned that the number could rise again as restrictions are gradually lifted. &gt; “As we gradually lift the circuit breaker measures, there is a risk that the community cases may rise again. This has been the experience of many countries which have seen a second wave of infections after relaxing their social distancing measures,” he said. &gt; On May 5, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners were allowed to resume acupuncture treatments for pain management, and medical halls linked to TCM outlets were also allowed to sell retail products. &gt; On Tuesday, home-based food businesses, hair salons and selected food retail outlets and food manufacturing firms were allowed to resume operations. &gt; Mr Gan added that Singapore has to remain “very careful, remain vigilant and minimise the risk of any sharp rise in cases, or large clusters in the community”. &gt; Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said in a Facebook post after the press conference that there have been requests for the relaxation of some measures, especially the restriction on visiting family. &gt; This, however, must be “considered very carefully” to ensure the safety of seniors, who are particularly vulnerable if they contract COVID-19, he said. &gt; Singapore had a total of 24,671 COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday, most of them foreign workers. &gt; Another 626 patients were discharged on Tuesday, a new daily high. &gt; On Sunday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 33 “false positive” cases after one of the laboratories experienced an “apparatus calibration issue” with one of its test kits. &gt; Two other cases, which initially had equivocal results, were also confirmed to be negative upon re-testing. &gt; Of these, three were from the community. &gt; These ""false positive"" cases were discovered as a result of a quality assurance programme put in place to check on test results, said MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak at the press conference on Tuesday. &gt; Authorities are giving the lab time to properly recalibrate and revalidate its test kits as well as work through its ""quality assurance processes"", he said. &gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589332077,fqfuqoe,t3_giorbh,2,singapore,633

"What you're highlighting isn't nessecarily STEM education. Here is an article by CNA that discusses it [link here](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/stem-arts-and-humanities-coronavirus-education-university-degree-12713556#.XrojXeMImiE.facebook) 'It might seem obvious Singaporeans should increase our longstanding focus on STEM, given the pandemic’s origins and solutions in these fields.' But when Germany is reopening, 'Philosophers, historians, theologians, jurists and pedagogical experts outnumbered scientists and medical specialists on an advisory group convened to decide reopening issues relating to ethics, law, human and social behavior, political power and the role of government in balancing the needs of health, the environment and the economy' On complaints and the need to understand scientific research and whatnot, STEM education isn't the way for people to be understanding. We can have the best mix of education in the world but still be ignorant on important issues. This can be achieved through critical thought, or maybe, the understanding of human nature(?). The solution to such things might not be so clear cut. There are many views on 'what might be important next time because of this', and i would agree with the article that arts and humanities will be much more important in the future than now, in Singapore.

"There are actually 3 different types of DNA tests, the one that tells you whatever % of a certain ethnicity you are is called an atDNA (autosomal DNA) test, other than that there is also a Y-DNA (paternal lineage) test and an mtDNA (maternal lineage) test, both of which assigns you to a haplogroup which shows that you are descended from a single male / female ancestor in which that mutation occurred, and interestingly certain haplogroups are also more closely associated with certain ethnicities. For example, Y-DNA Haplogroup O2-M134 or O2-M117 is closely associated with Han Chinese from the Central Plains, whereas Y-DNA Haplogroup O1-M119, or O1-M95 suggests ancestry from the indigenous ethnic minorities of Southern China with closer ties to Southeast Asians (eg Tai-Kadai / Thai / Lao / Zhuang, Austro-Asiatic / Khmer / Vietnamese, Austronesian / Malay / Filipino) While autosomal DNA tests for recent ancestry dating back only a few hundred years and results differ from company to company depending on their population reference database (hence it is less accurate and largely subjective), the Y-DNA and mtDNA tests are objective and far more accurate, haplogroups you are assigned to will not change at all no matter which company you test with and is used to trace ancestry back thousands of years along your paternal or maternal line. 23andMe tests for all 3 (atDNA, Y-DNA, mtDNA), and from my experience with them customer service was prompt and swift. I'll assume this new CircleDNA test only tests for autosomal DNA, and it's absurdly expensive in comparison to 23andMe. No point taking this CircleDNA test (which I think is from Hong Kong??), I'd say just go for 23andMe.",1589330586,fqfs2ej,t1_fesd0zf,1,singapore,278

Cannot stand for hrs since and does not have a perm job since NSF. Even doing office work, I also scream when phone ring/ compouter make noise/ door open etc. [https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/non-epileptic-seizures](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/non-epileptic-seizures) My symptons: difficulty breathing, screaming for a few seconds when startled easily by loud noises/ physical contact, heart palapatuions, seizures which can last for hrs. I waS downgraded from PES A / B to PES C due to GAD seizures. After NS, The polyclinic doctor directed me to IMH (no choice) as I wanted a perm excuse for excuse range (PES C MO only gave me a temp 7 weeks excuse for PES C BMT only). There were a few times that they gave injections in the midst of seizures. I was warded twice for one day each due to the public calling ambulance because of my anxiety attacks outside. I hate the experience because onced my symptons of seizures and breathing subside, I can walk again. IMH has job club (with occupatuional therapists as intermediarey and point of contact) that has employers hiring people with mental health issues (unsure about SGH and NUH). They only have manual labour employes though which I cannot do -cannot stand for long hrs without seizures due to NSF . I was dismissed from IMH job club because of my seizures at IMH/ client's premises when due to sign contract. The communiy wellness ctr which they may route mental health patients to depending on patients' location improved now,. I used to see different drs every time at cwc but now only one dr now. For psychologists, my first is a doctorate PHd (Senior psychologist) so more expensive . Psychologist (title) with masters is more affordable. I am on comcare since 2013 (Dr at IMH certified me unfit for work yearly) The mediation changed a lot over the years. MY medication is fluoxetine, quetiapine and Mirtszapine now. Seeing psychologist to talk about things is complimentary to just popping medication and hoping that thing can automativcall y be better.

"Yes this right here. As a rider I've gotten my fair share of restaurants who act deaf when we ask questions. Even simple questions like ""Is all the food inside?"" cos some places like to just dump completed orders on a table without tying the bag up or any indication that the food was done. Or start shouting at us the moment we put one foot into their shop even though the order is already sitting there waiting to be taken, and no staff seems to realise we've already reached. Wait outside the restaurant we're invisible. Call for staff also no one want to respond. But one foot in restaurant suddenly we become very visible to them alr. But serve walk-in customers suddenly all sunshine and rainbows. I've made it a point to inform customers when restaurants are excessively and consistently rude to riders - let the customers decide for themselves whether they want to support such behaviours from restaurants. To be fair, there are some very nice restaurants with amazing staff (I've posted the exceptional ones here before), but there're also those that're really bad. Best case scenario they treat us as nonexistent, worst case they attempt verbal and physical agression to get us out of their store. EDIT: Grab riders - you can report any aggression from restaurants by going to Help Centre &gt; Report a Serious Incident, then select the ""Merchant"" option. It's a very short form, and you'll get a call back from Grab's investigation team within 5 minutes. Based on what I gathered the last time I called in, they're empowered to shut down a restaurant and cancel all orders if the situation gets too out of hand. If you see another rider involved in an altercation with a restaurant that could get ugly, do fill in that form but make it clear that you're not involved but another rider is.

The authorities understand this desire to be physically connected again, he said. &gt; ""While we would like to allow them to see one another... we have to be quite cautious in moving on such a measure. &gt; ""Particularly when it comes to the elderly, because we all know that they are vulnerable, and if they were to catch the virus, the disease is potentially lethal for them."" &gt; Mr Wong was speaking at a virtual press conference yesterday. &gt; Meanwhile, the Health Ministry announced 884 new cases in Singapore, taking its tally past 24,000. Three of the new cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents. &gt; Singapore's circuit breaker measures came into force on April 7 and were to last till May 4. &gt; They were later extended by a month to June 1. &gt; As part of moves to curb the Covid-19 spread, all social gatherings with friends and family members who do not live in the same household have had to stop. &gt; People, however, can still visit their elderly relatives if these seniors need help with daily needs. &gt; However, they have to take precautions, such as observing personal hygiene, minimising physical contact and not visiting if one is unwell. &gt; Toh Wen Li --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589329155,fqfpfsy,t3_ginxi2,1,singapore,311

"And for a further example of PHE questionable stances, take a look at the public spat between PHE and the Resuscitation Council UK. Initially, PHE seems to have taken the stance that chest compressions where an Aerosol Generating Procedure, thus full PPE required. This resulted in a brief flurry of comments that that would mean that nurses on the wards would need to put on PPE before starting CPR, with quotes to ""There is no Emergency in a Pandemic"". This provoked something of a backlash and PHE quickly issued a clarification that Chest Compressions are not aerosol generating. Then the actually authority on life support stepped in, The Resus Council UK, who's word is the law when it comes to resuscitation. They put out an updated algorithm requiring full PPE for chest compressions, advising that defib pads could be placed on the patient in the interim, but staff should get into full PPE before starting compressions. This resulted in a public 'argument' on twitter between PHE and RCUK, with PHE trying to justifying its stance by fishing out Scotish NHS white paper which largely depended upon this suspect Tran et al (2012) study. Its probably no fault of the Scottish NHS, someone was probably asked to do a rapid review and wasnt very thorough. What is deeply suspect is that PHE didnt critically appraise the evidence they were using, convenient how it supported their position isnt it? Eventually, PHE conceded to RCUK and got back in its box regarding chest compressions. But then NERVTAG published its rapid review (and guess what Tran et al (2012) reared its head again (though they at least do consider other studies too), and the advice shifted yet again. As you can imagine this has left healthcare staff in a difficult position, who's guidance should they follow? This already comes at a sensitive time regarding resuscitation e.g. there was a care home nurse who was sanctioned by the NMC for not performing CPR on a corpse, not someone just keeled over, an actual corpse. Of course there is the priviso, your not dead until your warm and dead, but when faced with someone who's at the end of their life, who is now waxy, cold, stiff and definitely not breathing and who hasnt been immersed in a cold lake, perhaps the right thing to do is to grant that person some dignity rather than breaking their ribs.

"I haven't looked into it but typically the nukes provide between 25 to 30ish% of the total UK power when all are operational. UK currently has 8(?) Nuke sites so you'd need 3 times that amount I guess? The real problem is demand isn't consistent and nukes operate best as a consistent baseline load. You don't want to be raising and lowering the load on a nuke to match demand. Gas sites are perfect for demand spikes as they can be synchronised within 30 minutes I think, definitely less than an hour. From what I remember there's only 4 sites that are being or were planned to be built on, one of which was being driven by Horizon nuclear which is currently mothballed.

"big ass load of metal spinning inside of some magnets generates electricity, it has energy intrinsic due to its motion, if suddenly there is a heavier demand on the grid the grid will draw more energy from this large mass slowing it down, giving time for more steam to be made and pushed through the turbines to compensate. allowing the grid to essentially have a variable ammount of demand.

"Basically you get a known supply of power that you can reasonably rely on from coal, gas, Nuclear etc. You want X amount of energy from those sources? You get X amount of energy because all you need to do is contact the power stations and have them meet the required limits. With solar or wind energy you get whatever the weather permits, which can be high it can be low and it can vary all over the place from minute to minute. So while renewable like solar and wind is vastly more preferable to coal or gas it is also much less reliable. The key to solving this would be efficient long term battery storage, that way on your surplus days you could store the excess energy and then on your deficit days you can tap into that battery power. That field is advancing but its not quite there yet. Though one method that has been used for years is to take excess energy and use it to pump water into reservoirs, then at times of high demand you open those reservoirs up and let them drive hydro-electric power stations.

"Nuclear power consumes very little fuel. Unlike a coal or gas power plant that literally sets its fuel on fire to heat something, nuclear power relies on heat that comes from the controlled splitting of uranium atoms, which turns them into lighter atoms and releases heat and radiation. When this happens, only a small amount of the uranium fuel is actually used up, though you need a certain percentage of the fuel to be unconsumed to use it. Also uranium is actually really common - you can find it all across the world. Recent developments have even meant that we might be able to use what we currently consider to be spent fuel.

And you only needed to look at the constant news stories with photos of hundreds of people in Regent's Park not following social distancing to see they were millienials.

Whilst I agree, there is more to be learnt, there is increasing evidence of the epidemiology of the disease considering there’s been more than 4 million confirmed cases world-wide. There’s already a proposed model for the relative reduced risk in children that is being investigated. Children will have to return to school before a vaccine or effective treatment will be found, that is an almost certainty. There is good evidence that children are at reduced risk, the area that is much more debatable and does need more research is how good they are at spreading the disease and whether they transmit (and to what extent) the virus when asymptomatic.

I really hope the move to more smart meters and smart homes in general help this shift (current privacy issues aside - the main reason I'm not automating more of my home right now). If people can see on a dashboard how much energy they're using they can visualise it like a tap which is a good analogy. Combine this with smart learning and the automated systems will turn on devices when they're needed. The end user will notice no difference but the appliance will be off more. The people I know using smart home heating definitely heat their home for less time than they used to with a static system. Your portable rig sounds pretty cool and like a fun project to get into off-grid life. One day I dream about that option. When mobile internet is more reliable I think I could definitely see myself moving further away from cities with an off-grid lifestyle. Particularly if work from home doesn't go away fully.

The worldometers website is using New York data which shows that 0.04% of those who passed away were under 18 https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/ This is surprisingly comparable to influenza (for children, for older people it's much worse obviously) I oppose the reopening of schools because I'm afraid that the parents might get sick from the children. So knowing the children are infected with Corona then who would look after them? If the parents are bedridden then who is going to do the shopping, cook for them and feed them?

"1. Less than half of the students will be returning. Specifically reception, year 1 and year 6. That means you can loose up to 50% of the support staff, though teachers will be spread thin. 2. Those that are available should help. Remaining shortfall can be made up of student teachers, teaching assistants and remaining teachers from years 2,3,4 and 5. If the situation becomes critical, see if you can get some secondary teachers in on temporarily or something. 3. Give them a chair and tell them to sit on it. It may not work all the time, but with constant reinforcement it'd be good enough to function. 4. As mentioned, with less than half of the students returning, half of the teachers are now available for tasking. That should cover the immediate shortfall and have enough to crease a small reserve. 5. I've no real answer for this one. I think PPE should be prioritised for medical staff rather than educational staff, but if they want to buy their own that's up to them. 6. The teachers are the valuable ones in this situation, the support staff are secondary. There being less kids in general will reduce the load on the support staff, but the decrease in class size will keep the teachers spread thin. And, not to sound too apathetic, the main requirement for a lunchtime supervisor is a DBS check. They shouldn't be too hard to hire in. 7. That can be handled with appropriate signage.

"Non-renewables won't run out. We've got hundreds of years worth of coal reserves under our feet in the UK, even if we went back to full reliance on coal power. But we won't, and have been phasing it out for decades, because it's filthy. Who was it who shut the coal mines again btw? As renewables - there's still a long way to go and we're leading the way. We can get a lot of our electricity from renewables when the conditions are right. Unfortunately, sometimes they aren't, and there's no clear answer. Wind doesn't always blow, it's often dark, tidal is an environmental disaster, and storage options are prohibitively expensive (for now). So that's where nuclear comes in. It relies on non-renewable fuel, but we could power the whole planet on nuclear and not have to worry about running out. It creates no pollution aside from spent fuel, which is easily dealt with (though admittedly an expensive and complex task), is extremely reliable, incredibly safe, and aside from construction costs, almost free. The issue is, as you hint at, the construction costs are enormous, but you cannot put a price on the future of humanity. Look at the current situation as a prime example. If you dismiss the fucking around from successive governments, Hinckley Point C will have gone from breaking ground to generating electricity in five years. Get some Chinese investment in, do some deals, we could get 10 built before 2030. That would be everything we'd need, and ZERO reliance on fossil fuels. Then, as we'd have massive amounts of almost free electricity, move all long-distance lorry freight to rail freight - interestingly this is what people miss about HS2. Yes, it is utterly insane and stupid to spend that much money on cutting a train journey from London to Birmingham by 15 minutes, but it frees up the existing lines for freight.

Personally, I believe in order to reduce the instability of the peaks, the government should reinstate grant's to encourage more solar or small scale wind generation, paired with storage where possible. Having a decent percentage of households with storage would take pressure off at peak times. It would be an expensive scheme for the government to fund, but would show a real commitment to clean energy. The interesting energy figures will start to emerge when electric vehicles become more prominent over the next few years.

"&gt;A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis estimates that it will cost the Exchequer almost £300 billion this year and could require measures including an increase in income tax, the end of the triple lock on state pension increases and a two-year public sector pay freeze. &gt;The Telegraph can reveal that a Treasury document drawn up for Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, sets out a proposed ""policy package"" of tax increases and spending reductions which may have to be announced within weeks in order to ""enhance credibility and boost investor confidence"" in the British economy. &gt;The document, dated May 5 and marked ""Official – market sensitive"", reveals that the ""base case scenario"" now forecasts that Britain will have a £337 billion budget deficit this year, compared to the forecast £55 billion in March's Budget. &gt;It says tax rises and spending cuts which would raise between £25 billion and £30 billion – equivalent to a 5p increase in the basic rate of income tax – would be needed to fund the increased debt, and presents Mr Sunak with a menu of proposed measures to make up the shortfall. &gt;In the worst case scenario – a so-called ""L-shaped economic decline"" – the figure would increase to a £516 billion deficit in the current financial year, rising to a cumulative £1.19 trillion over five years. This would require up to £90 billion in annual tax rises and/or spending cuts over the next few years. &gt;Even the best-case V-shaped scenario, in which the economy falls sharply but recovers equally quickly – described as ""optimistic"" in the document – would lead to a £209 billion deficit this year. &gt;The disclosure of the bleak economic predictions, which would suggest that Britain's finances are in their weakest state since the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, helps explain why the Government is now urging people to return to work where possible. &gt;On Sunday evening, Boris Johnson set out the country's strategy for beginning to exit the lockdown but was criticised by trade unions and opposition MPs for apparently rushing the return to work. &gt;The Treasury document warns ministers that, if Britain's economy does not recover soon, the country could be thrown into a 1976-style ""sovereign debt crisis"", a situation that led to an international bailout. &gt;On Tuesday, the Chancellor announced that the furlough scheme to subsidise wages would be extended until October but that employers would have to pick up more of the bill from the end of July. &gt;The scheme is now estimated to cost £100 billion, with almost 10 million workers now either paid by the Government-funded initiative or by universal credit. &gt;Mr Sunak is advised that, to ""stabilise debts"" in the base case scenario, he will have to increase taxes or cut spending to raise between £25 billion and £30 billion a year. &gt;In the worst case scenario, he will have to raise £80 billion to £90 billion a year. He is advised that an announcement on how to fund the huge increase in spending may have to be made imminently, but that the tax and spend changes could be delayed to avoid derailing an economic recovery. &gt;The document says the Chancellor ""has indicated a preference for accepting a higher but broadly stable level of debt"" after the crisis. However, it adds: ""As debt is likely to reach significantly higher levels after the crisis, it will be important to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio and prevent debt from continuing to grow on an unsustainable trajectory."" &gt;The document advises Mr Sunak that it is now likely to become necessary to break at least one of the Conservatives' key manifesto pledges not to increase taxes or scrap the triple lock on state pension rises. &gt;It states: ""To fill a gap this size [in the public finances] through tax revenue risers would be very challenging without breaking the tax lock. To raise fiscally significant amounts, we would either have to increase rates/thresholds in one of the broad-based taxes (IT, NICS, VAT, CT) or reform one of the biggest tax reliefs (eg pensions tax)."" &gt;It adds that it would be ""economically better to break the tax lock to achieve revenue of this scale than attempt to raise this level of revenue"" and would also be ""important to consider measures that support a growth-friendly composition of tax (consumption/property taxes rather than taxes on income/profits). &gt;""We should also look at opportunities for new taxes that could meet some of the Government's broader policy objectives, raising revenue to relieve long-term fiscal pressures (eg an NHS/social care surcharge or new carbon/green taxes). A 1 per cent increase in the basic rate in the basic rate of income tax would raise around £5 billion p.a."" &gt;Mr Sunak is also advised that there are ""further options to address the challenge through spending and welfare"" reductions. &gt;The document suggests a two-year freeze on public sector pay could generate savings of £6.5 billion by 2023-24 while ""stopping the rising cost"" of the pension triple lock would produce savings of £8 billion a year. &gt;Officials have also been asked to provide advice on the timing of an announcement, which could take the form of a summer Budget. The document advises the Chancellor that the ""timing, pace and composition of any consolidation should be managed carefully to avoid the risk of stifling the economic recovery"". &gt;However, it adds: ""The timing of an effective medium-term strategy should also take into the account the right time to use political capital, and there may be benefits to setting out future consolidation plans now alongside support for the recovery."" &gt;The document, drawn up by the Chancellor's policy advisers, says ""a more realistic scenario"" than the idea of a V-shaped recovery is a ""prolonged recovery and some permanent damage to the economy"" – in other words, a U-shaped recovery. &gt;In the Treasury's own worst case prediction, the economy would go through an ""L-shaped"" recovery, meaning economic output would remain below current forecasts for the next five years, leading to a large structural deficit and a budget deficit running to one third of GDP. &gt;Mr Sunak has faced repeated questions about how he intends to recoup the cost of the coronavirus bailout package, but has so far refused to be drawn into discussions about future tax rises or squeezes on public spending. &gt;A Treasury source described the measures set out in the document as ""a summary of all the existing levers"" rather than a recommendation of any particular course of action, and said no decisions had yet been made about revenue-raising policies. &gt;The document reveals that the Treasury's own base case scenario – in other words, what it thinks is most likely – estimates that the current budget deficit, forecast at £55 billion for 2020-21 before the pandemic, will actually be £337 billion because of the cost of bailouts and lost tax revenues. The base case puts the deficit at £83 billion in 2021-22, dropping to £32 billion by 2024-25. &gt;In a worst case scenario it will be £516 billion, or £450 billion more than pre-pandemic forecasts. That dwarfs the budget for NHS England, which stands at £129 billion. &gt;The most optimistic scenario given by Treasury advisers is that the deficit will run to £209 billion in the current financial year and could even return to surplus by 2023-24. &gt;A Treasury spokesman said: ""The Government's focus is on supporting families and businesses through this difficult period. That's why we announced an extension to the furlough scheme, which has already saved millions of jobs, earlier.""",1589323618,fqfesy3,t3_gimagz,7,unitedkingdom,1250

"I'm saying that if this were a wide scale problem, that secondary teachers could be relocated. I don't know how it could be done. Maybe it'd be a government system. Maybe the schools would work it out amount themselves. The shift could be lessened by having the primary teachers focus on the younger groups and just have secondaries take over year 6. It's only a year off the age group that they could be teaching anyway. I did some (really) quick research into it and I can't see an issue with qualifications. It looks like there is a specific course for under 5s (EYTS), but primary and secondary share the same base teaching qualification. &gt;D2.

In practice, it is for each school to decide whether an individual has sufficient subject knowledge or experience of the age group to be appointed to any specific position. It may be more feasible in areas with recruitment difficulties and/or in shortage subjects, and undertaking additional subject study may improve the chances. [https://www.abdn.ac.uk/careers/resources/documents/4456.pdf](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/careers/resources/documents/4456.pdf) It looks like the QTS is mandatory and every other standard is set on a case by case basis.

"&gt; So make people redundant and go on universal credit so they have no expendable cash and no taxable income? Okay? What is your point? If business's aren't viable these people are unemployed, that is the reality. You can't just magic an economic downturn away as much as people are trying. That isn't reality. You can mitigate, plan, and give people options. But facts are a lot of people aren't going back to work, there isn't any work for them to do. &gt;Redundancies costs businesses and it puts them in a hard position if there is no work due to the lockdown. They cost them less than holding onto workers doing nothing, and they don't cost much at all for workers under 5 years of services, under 2 years they cost nothing. &gt;Without the furlough the company would have had to make redundancies straight away and eat up a lot of cash paying wages for people they hope to need going forward. Yes it would? What is your point? You can't just pay every zombie businesses complete wage bill forever. The business is either viable or it isn't, if it isn't, make workers redundant and let them move into areas where there is demand. Then make demand, because there is no demand. People aren't keeping their job for the sake of it, that is just stupid and propping up said business is a terrible idea economically. No one has ever claimed there was anything wrong with furloughing people short term. But once people are going back to work, if their job isn't there any more because there is no demand, that is that. If that can be predicted pre-going back to work, an intelligent business would make people redundant sooner rather than later. Businesses certainly aren't in the business of having valueless expenditure, especially in a downturn. &gt;Anyhow the benefit of UBI in terms of boosting the economy comes from the mid to high earners not those unemployed or on the poverty line. For those already earning enough to live comfortably it's disposable cash and boosts the economy. For everyone else it just allows them to live with the basics. No it doesn't. High earners get taxed and end up paying for it. They just can't whine that poor people are getting a hand out because they are getting the same hand out. It works by paying poor people money, they then spend this money in local businesses and then it all comes back in taxation. Poor people generally immediately spend all there money and can't afford to save it, this means it immediately starts to be pulled back by taxation and can then be redistributed again. The economy will collapse if everyone decides it is time to save for a rainy day, it is very much a Ponzi scheme, which is why the government is trying to stop the rug being pulled out from it. UBI is basically irrelevant to high earners as they would be better off not paying for it, the taxation to them means they end up with less money than if they just kept theirs. The advantages come from the basically zero bureaucracy and idiots not being able to whine because everyone gets the same amount of money. If someone else is a scrounger, so are they. &gt;Right now if your not in one of the businesses that's thriving from the lockdown or furloughed your likely on reduced pay and/or hours (I'm on 80% hours/pay). No it wouldn't, and many people are still working, I am, most of my friends are. Have a laptop and you could work from anywhere in the world. The question is of productivity, it is most likely vastly reduced. Also if you work for a decent company and are skilled they will most likely be topping up your salary so you don't go get another job. &gt;So less expendable cash which UBI would counter until things start to recover within businesses. Once again, UBI isn't a magic money tree, it is paid through taxation. High and medium earnings will not be better off from it directly.",1589323121,fqfdt6l,t1_fqfa97d,1,unitedkingdom,686

"So make people redundant and go on universal credit so they have no expendable cash and no taxable income? Redundancies costs businesses and it puts them in a hard position if there is no work due to the lockdown. Make immediate cuts, put people on unpaid leave or have people being paid to do nothing. Where I work put over 90% of the staff on furlough as the demand dropped to barely above zero. Over the last two weeks it's dropped to around 80-85% furloughed with it slowly getting better. Without the furlough the company would have had to make redundancies straight away and eat up a lot of cash paying wages for people they hope to need going forward. A lot of businesses are going to go bust with this, but a hell of a lot more would go without something like furlough. Yes invest in the future, but without businesses still existing doesn't matter how well someone is trained if the job isn't there. Investing in the future and furlough aren't mutual exclusive. Anyhow the benefit of UBI in terms of boosting the economy comes from the mid to high earners not those unemployed or on the poverty line. For those already earning enough to live comfortably it's disposable cash and boosts the economy. For everyone else it just allows them to live with the basics. Right now if your not in one of the businesses that's thriving from the lockdown or furloughed your likely on reduced pay and/or hours (I'm on 80% hours/pay).

"I agree with you 100% and am grateful to you for having worded this so concisely yet simply (cog-fog is a real b*#%h). The problem is that COVID-19 is so new to the greater bulk of the world population that there is very little immunity, let alone herd immunity. Hopefully this will change; hopefully we will be able to create a protocol that allows us to slow the replication of the virus and also a vaccine. The 20,000 influenza deaths are genuinely unavoidable, they happen even with treatment protocols and antiviral medications, even though humans have herd immunity from it, even though most everyone has natural (vs. acquired) immunity because they themselves have had it at some point in their lives. As sad as it is, that 20,000 is going to happen regardless. I'm in no way making light of the loss of life or pain experienced in relation to those deaths but the thing that people should be focused on regarding that number (with regard to COVID-19) is that we should be hoping that we don't have the same proportion of death with COVID-19 once the pandemic passes. I'm part of the at-risk population - I have multiple sclerosis, Graves Disease and Ehlers-Danlos (aka a bunch of autoimmune disorders). If I were to ignore social distancing and were to get COVID-19, I run the risk not only of a coronavirus infection but also of triggering a flare-up/relapse of any of the diseases that I have, which could be equally dangerous. The same is true for my boyfriend and my family; they are participating in distancing as a means of protecting me. I am also anxious to get the economy back to a level that is functional for not just the rich (especially since that sure as hell doesn't include me), but I also grasp that it is something that is - unfortunately - going to take time. Can we afford to wait for a vaccine?- probably not. But that's not a good argument to just go back to the way things were. Instead, people who are able to survive an infection need to get infected (and survive) but they need to do so in a way that doesn't risk overrunning the hospitals or our supply of equipment. Right now, as I see it, the best way to get to that functional state is to increase testing and implement controlled infections (think pox parties). So you get tested, stay isolated until you get the results, and afterwards, if you have no immunity, you can opt to be infected (so that you can get it out of the way/build immunity that will contribute to the herd immunity), and if you choose to do that, go somewhere where you can be infected but also be observed in case things get crazy (remember that we still have no real way of knowing who will get hit how hard, so this would have to happen in batches so as not to overwhelm the healthcare system). Once you've got immunity, return to work. Repeat throughout the population until the majority is inoculated against the coronavirus. And yes, people will still have to participate in some degree of mitigation between now and herd immunity, but the world has already changed, and a lot of the changes are going to stick no matter what. We need to try to adapt instead of just being pissed that things aren't going to be the same. Just my two cents... “¯\_(ツ)_/¯“",1589320961,fqf9h23,t1_fqezlln,1,unitedkingdom,581

"...Yes, I have thought this through. It only takes reading a few of these comment chains to see exactly how much I have thought this through. I recognise that the size of classrooms can vary, but the average UK class size is around 27 students. As far as I know, class room sizes reflect that number. The national guidelines on school buildings state that the total dimensions of teaching areas within the school should be between 2m\^2 per student and 2.2m\^m per student. If you half the number of students, you double the amount of space available. Spread the remaining students out. If you have 10 teachers teaching 300 students you get a class of 30. That's above the average class size in the UK. If half of those student don't return, you've got 10 teachers teaching 150 students. That gives you the government recommended class size. If you've got classrooms that can't fit the full 15 students then move in a smaller group. If you're running low on space or teachers then set up bigger classes somewhere else. Set them up in gyms and halls, exam style. Use teaching assistants, supply teachers, student teachers and if you're still short then call in secondary school teachers. If that won't work then don't have the teachers take the class directly, have teaching assistants take front and have the actual teachers float between multiple classrooms assigning work and answering questions. There are always solutions, you just need to think of them.",1589319329,fqf6348,t1_fqf1l4r,0,unitedkingdom,249

"You have to think, a restaurant gets limited by how many people it can seat. Delivery and takeout is only limited by how much you can push out and how fast. If they're hitting there limit, they're exceeding there expectations and probably trying to figure out how to push out more. Restaurants which adapt and adapt fast will come out of this very well. Edit: they're probably hitting the limit as they're offering the full menu rather than simplifying/modifying for delivery/takeout only. Restaurants can offer more as orders tend to be staggered, so less pressure on the cooks which is the bottleneck. When you offer delivery, you can get a lot of orders in the space on a couple of minutes.

"Wasn't part of the problem that apparently police and social services didn't want to pursue the abusers in case they 'appeared racist'? I remember that being thrown about. If two potential causes are 'not wanting to appear racist' or pure incompetence, without evidence of the latter many people will believe the former. In the eyes of the British public, I am willing to bet that incompetence would be forgiven but being 'too PC' will not. Imo the British public didn't particularly care about rape victims then, they don't particularly care about them now and they don't really care about police incompetence either.
