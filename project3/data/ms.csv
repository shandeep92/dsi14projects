"In primary school. Had multiple crazy teachers. One of them punished a poor girl because she wouldn't speak or answer her question. The girl had mental/behavioural issues or something, I'm not exactly sure, I think it's called selective mutism. She probably also had autism. Throughout the six years I've known her, I've never heard her speak a word, but her parents claim she speaks normally at home. She had no close friends and only nodded or shook her head to answer questions. This teacher, a maths teacher, asked her to write the answer of a question on the whiteboard. The girl just stood very still in front of the class, almost unmoving. She looked terrified, as she almost always did. At this point the teacher started to loose her patience. During then it was already known that the answer was D, and the teacher insisted her to write ""D"" on the whiteboard. She, however, did not. She just stood, still, scared, eyes open wide, marker in her hand. The teacher exploded. She told the girl to stand outside of the class while wearing a kopiah on her head over her tudung to embarass her as other students passed by. The girl was already sobbing by then, and eventually we had to comfort her. I felt terrible for her, whatever issues she had, the incident probably ruined her self-esteem terribly. This teacher was the same teacher who told a group of students who failed to clean the class while it was their duty, to, haih, disgustingly pick up the dandruffs from the head of this one boy in our class.",1589352889,fqgpfqj,t3_girout,3,malaysia,269

Mom wasn't great at letting me know it wasn't me either, that's another story. Anyway, towards the end of time when I was in school, I lost my place in the library, went from chirpy and lovable to withdrawn, depressed and worrisome. Had massive anxiety every time it was her class. School never stepped in. Mom didn't either so I was collateral damage. 20 years down, I still wish she would die painfully and with immense suffering.

Kindness costs nothing. Respect costs nothing. For the supposed 'crimes' or transgressions from a minority within the group, people have painted an entire people by the same brush.

"&gt;See how racist you're being right now? Assuming the worst about malay? so assuming malays kids are going to grow up racist because if they dont mingle with other race is racist? but according to you in the first place, vernacular school is when kdis dont mingle with other race, and if non malays dont mingle with other races is going to grow up racist ? seriously. &gt;Lets not kid ourselves here. Supremacists exist in every race in Malaysia. Just look at the comment in this post. Wonder why this kind of people exists. Maybe because they aren't exposed to other race? Now what would the solution for that problem? i agree every race have their own racial pride, there's asshole in every group of people, but for a government to legally and forcefully recognized one is totally unacceptable. &gt;Is it segregating? Is it needed in our country? Will the abolishment of this policy helps strengthen unity between race by letting kids mingle with each other? Stop them from assuming the worst from each other like you just did? Then when they grow up maybe they can change our constitution system? Answer this question first before you assume the worst about others please. Or maybe you like to stay in your own bubble and keep pretending to be the only victim and pretend you're guilt free? I agree that verrnacular schools are not needed, but it's just there as a choice you don't want to learn another language then dont, it's up to you. It's exactly like subject or degree selection. or like what pre u course you going to take, STPM? A-levels? IB? Seriously the thing you all try to justify your supremacist thinking. So instead of opting for the logical part of unity by treating everyone as the same equally, you decide to remove an entire medium of conduct? So if take away vernacular school means we can also remove trashy policies like bumi supremacist rights? If yes 99% sure every non will be for it.",1589347087,fqgieoa,t1_fqg1k0u,1,malaysia,338

"For me, it doesn't have to be investment banking specifically, it can be a company analyst in terms of their investment, I wasn't exactly fixated in specific industry, but the role itself, it can be the same position but in somewhere outside of banks I did have asked a person whos sort of a trainer in CIMB, so she told me to research for CFA as i kinda have the specific interest in investments analysis. To me it wasn't just where I work, its what I'm doing that matters the most. Personally I think I can do sales, its just not really my cup of tea to be honest, and it does demotivate you in times knowing too well youre doing something that's not what you want, so I'm also looking at someth thats not investment related, like operational and stuffs.

It irritates me so much when they can't communicate with us because we can't tell what's wrong with them but I still treat them with respect. I once had a Bangladeshi patient that broke down in tears after a few attempts to communicate failed. Just imagine yourself in his shoes. Alone in a foreign country, sick, and you can't tell them what's wrong, and everyone was annoyed by him. It's a horrible feeling.

"For now, the default advice for most fresh graduates is to **stick with your current role**, if possible. &gt;I dont plan on staying on my current position after my 6 month probation (started in march, so its my 3rd month) mainly because I don't like the nature of the job and also the current circumstances in the market. If you think that the current circumstances in the market is bad, you will probably be aware that the job market is not looking great either. Many places are having hiring freezes of some sort and assuming that you are looking for an analyst position in some sell-side research firm, those places are not likely to be the exception to this rule. That is not to say that the investment research are not hiring at all but in all likelihood, these organisations will likely be looking for staff with some experience (or basically someone that they need not devote too much resources training). With all due respect, your CGPA is not necessarily one that would attract confidence unless you have some other things to back you up. Having said that, definitely consider taking this time to equip yourself with more skills -- more skills is always better than... less skills. CFA is a good start but note that your employers are not likely to be impressed if you simply list ""*CFA Level I Candidate*"" in your CV -- pretty much anybody with the registration fees can claim to enrol for the programme. It would be more persuasive if you had something like ""*Passed the CFA Level I Exam*"". Also, if you are serious about attempting the exam, I recommend preparing immediately especially if you are attempting the December 2020 exams (IIRC, Level I has two exams per year) -- the papers are pretty challenging with a pretty low pass rate to boot (around 35%, 45% and 55% for Levels I, II and III). If it makes you feel any better though, I dare say that most people in the equity research industry don't have a full CFA designation anyway. Having that designation is a bit like one of those optional achievements -- it just shows that you know your shit. That said, it is not doom and gloom for you. You are 23 years old -- that's pretty young so you have quite some time to grow. You have some pretty well-defined goals on where you want to go and how you want to go about pursuing it. That's a huge positive; the challenge is for you to actually grow rather than just having the potential to do so. Good luck!",1589342764,fqgcdk5,t3_giqj8d,3,malaysia,439

Coupled with pictures of them with malay woman, then saying they are here to rampas all bini. Wha???? But i do fear them. Not because of who they are, but what they might be.

"CFA can be a good value add but I don't know if it's still the gold standard. Passing L1/L2 (can be a challenging endeavour and time consuming esp L2) makes you stand out a bit more on paper. Though the bankers I know do not have the qualification themselves. Jobs with audit firms will be a nice stepping stone, technical skill wise, if you want to be in investment banking specifically. Since you're already with CIMB, you should ask within your firm and see if a transfer to the research (or related) department is possible and what are the routes one should take, if you are looking for an analyst role. As with all things, it's important to know someone who know someone. At the same time you also have to be realistic and know that most jobs in banking, are essentially sales jobs, one way or another. Even as an investment analyst you need sales/people skill to gain access to information and to present them. Good luck.",1589342630,fqgc66z,t3_giqj8d,2,malaysia,168

Right before MCO commenced, they started temperature screenings at the entrance. I also just checked their website which states they will deny entry to anyone with a temp above 37 once gyms are allowed to open. This is the type of SOP I expect to see in place.

"Does anyone else think that it's ridiculous to make a law not to bring children out? School and daycare are still not allowed to open, but people already have to come in to work. Some parents have no choice but to go out for necessities or run errands, so how should they manage their kids? Abandon them at home? I'm seriously asking, because I see a ton of mob mentality surrounding this issue. I know that there are parents who don't give a f, those cases are usually pretty obvious. Both parents present, and the kids are super young. But these keyboard warriors are up in arms over a dad taking his toddler to the pasar, or a mom taking her little one to the supermarket. We don't know the full story, they might be so desperate for essentials and haven't been out in weeks. They may need something urgently and no one is around to watch their kid. They may have been left by their SO to fend for themselves. Who knows? I'm just concerned that as usual, we are not thinking of the less fortunate because we don't have that same experience.

A Japanese person hating a Korean person isn't racist--certainly discriminatory, bad, etc, but not **racist--because Japanese and Koreans are basically indistinguishable based on physical traits alone.** Race is a category which is malleable and ill defined, but generally is one category above ethnicity. EX: Koreans and Japanese are both of the ""Northeast Asian"" race. Poles and Scots are of the ""North European"" race. If you can't tell the difference between the groups when they're naked and silent, then they're the same race. I remember a similar survey showing India to be the ""most racist country"".

"I saw a thread above discussing how Malays are perceived to be less competent in the workplace because it is assumed that they have access to educational resources ie scholarships, quota to public universities. I would like to start a new thread here, if it's okay. As a Malay, I hope more Malays would see why too much help from the govt can actually impede our growth. In my line of work, where there aren't many Malays ( I won't say what field), when I first started, I had a feeling that people assumed that I got the job only because the company really needed more Malays, that this was the primary reason I was hired, and not due to my skill. I am not denying the fact that my ""Malayness"" helped me, because this particular industry does not have much Malays working in it, well comparatively at least. But because of that perception, I worked very hard to prove that I deserved that job. It was only after several months in that the bosses and my coworkers saw that I am actually da-bomb at this work, and that my Chinese boss, who hired me, as opposed to another Chinese candidate who went to the interview, made the right decision. My point is, arguing that we need help all the time devalue those who did actually make it far. As someone from a low-income background, I studied hard. Worked hard to improve my English. I made myself marketable for the job market, despite my lack of social network. And I made it. But as soon as I entered the job market, this perception affects me. Quite honestly, I'm not scared of open competition, because I believe in myself. I worked hard to cultivate my skills and competency, and if I worked hard enough, there is no reason why I would need a special category in order to succeed. In fact, I would say assistance and handout should be need based, not race based. I have been called ""kacang lupakan kulit"". If that's your take on this, you are entitled to it. But some of us choose to work on ourselves to make it out there, instead of begging for more assistance, in addition to the help that we have already got. I understand that asking to do away with the special privileges is pushing too much in too little time, but please do realise that ultimately, it is you, that makes or breaks you, not the amount of govt assistance.",1589308487,fqejaq7,t3_gi1uw0,1,malaysia,420

"Since a lot of the comments here already shat on you, I'll highlight a few good points in your work that you could carry on. 1. Your use of hard brush is fantastic in the way that you use to create form through shadowing. I genuinely like the way you shadow the clothes. I noticed some soft brushes as well. It's good that you're not overusing soft brushes/air brushes to create the form. I noticed that there are some balance in the way you used the brush. 2. Your linework is clean and that you actually attempted to use variable thickness of lines. But you need to know where and when should you use thick or thin lines. Thick would usually be for the shadowed parts and thin lines for the parts exposed to light. Overall, a good attempt. (Google line quality if you want to learn more) 3. I love how you used different colours to differentiate the darker parts of the hair. I think there is one thing that I really want to comment that nobody has mentioned here. Your skin tone doesn't feel alive. Try to use redder colour for skin tones as in real life, there's blood under your skin which makes you look alive. Honestly, I think this is a really good start in digital art. You have grasped a lot of the basic concepts. From this trajectory, I see that you can go far. If you want to learn more about digital art, I can recommend you this one youtuber that I found super helpful: Mohammed Agbadi.

"GST was the best tax system but no, someone got to abolish it. Because of the removal of GST, our deficit went up, our debt went up too.

LGE is truly a useless politician. Just look at Penang's accounting under his rule and you will know. On paper it is good, but deep down, he sold lands which Gerakan refuses to sell when they are in power. Under Gerakan, 18% of the land belongs to the state, after LGE finish his 2 term, only 9% left. LGE sold land to finance the state gov. Yet it is not enough, the debt kept on going up, so what he did was to sell the Penang Water company to Federal, the term is Fed will convert Penang's debt into soft loan.

"What kind of pigeon is it? Is it a full adult or a juvenile? Do you have a picture? You probably won't have luck with animal shelters or wildlife rehab centers I'm afraid. Most wildlife rehab only bother for endangered native species and if this pigeon is a feral rock pigeon (Columbia livia) it would be considered a pest. From your description, sounds a lot like the pigeon has been concussed, most likely from flying into a window glass pane (birds get confused by the reflection of the sky in the glass). In cases like this best thing you can do is put it in a cardboard box in a quiet corner, somewhere sheltered and safe from predators and give it time to recover and fly away on its own. Sadly, whether it recovers or not greatly depends on how injured it is. In this condition it's very unlikely to want to eat, but you can make some water or a high moisture fruit/veg such as a cucumber available to it just in case. Check on it every few hours. Don't force it to eat or drink, it might choke. If it's hungry, trust me, the bird will let you know. Injured birds can be very difficult to rehab.

"I'm the opposite from you. Schooled in SJK(C), then attended SMK for the first half of secondary school life but I was in the top class - 95% Chinese. Later went to another SMK which was 85-90% Chinese (huge emphasis on Chinese culture and had Chinese classes during regular class hours). I lean more towards Western mindset so I didn't really buy into cina superiority, but I definitely resented Malays for having opportunities handed out to them on a silver platter. Moved on to STPM, worked my ass off for CGPA 4.0 in Science stream (dat shiet was HARD), fully expected to get a place in one of my top 3 choices for public uni. But no, the gov decided to screw me over. I got my 7th choice out of 12. Later I discovered, the course that I desperately wanted to get into did not have a single STPM student for that year's intake. Only diploma, their own asasi, and matrics. Some even had lower scores than I did. And the dean had the nerve to tell me there was no favoritism. F u Anyway, that woke me up to reality. But at the same time, I started mingling with more Malays, and that really changed my perspective on them. Some of them are every bit the victims of this racial game as the non-malays are. Heck, I even found a Malay best friend, opposite gender some more. Don't give up conscioussolid9, I believe that you can find a Chinese best friend too!",1589299855,fqe0qsc,t1_fqdiya4,2,malaysia,254

"Depends on which side of Singapore :) Within local Singaporean citizens - there is still some minor form of stereotype between ethnicities occasionally (yeah the Malay/Chinese/Indian is blablabla) but it's rather bland compared to ours (just like their food haha sorry just can't miss this banter). Lots of deliberate social integration and forward thinking policies especially by the past generation leaders that would have done wonders for Malaysia if we put some effort in adapting it to local context - more or less a centralized whole hearted effort in embedding the ""we are Singaporeans"" mindset. Within Non-Singaporean context - there is quite a prevalent theme when it comes to negative connotations both in terms of social class (cue the dormitories) and the classic ""they are stealing our jobs"" (usually in the context of mid-high paying jobs or naturalized citizenship amongst athletes). Perhaps, just perhaps, this is a repercussion of the strong ""we are Singaporeans"" mindset above.",1589299589,fqe06ud,t1_fqc7vpo,1,malaysia,156

I think the predominant issue is *how* the sampling was done and even then, the design of the survey is problematic. It literally only asks *one* question (""*How big of a problem is racial discrimination in the country where you live?*"") with what I assume is on a scale of 1 to 10.

My university, IMU, has 4 orthopaedicians only, and might be willing to conisder a new one. There are more lecturers for the IM Department, but no harm trying as well. A sizable minority of our lecturers are not from Malaysia, and are very, very knowledgable as well as dedicated to making us the best doctors we can be. The Bukit Jalil campus has many lecturers, the Seremban one is smaller, but there is much more clinical work there. If your parents have the qualifications and dedication I have no doubt that employment will not be difficult. Just something to think about. That being said, I do not know what the requirements are, and that is something you may have to ask around.

"The game IMO is not as open world as World 3, which is one of my favourite Digimon game, but I think its as fun as World 3.

Though, when you digivolve or de-digivolve, your digimon lvl reset to 1. A bit grindy, just like World 3! Can't digivolve in battle though, have to go to a lab. There's also a DigiFarm, which is used to increase stats or search for good items or sidequests. It takes real life time though, so you develop an item, you'll have to wait 1 hour IRL. Can be decreased ofc. You cannot get OP 999 stats digimon though, can't explain it well, but there's a limit to how many bonus farm stats you can get, and digivolving or de-digivolving will not increase stats, it is based on the digimon itself.

"Different languages (eg: mother tongues other than Malay) are taught at a sekolah kebangsaan (ie what you claim to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô schools) as electives if there is sufficient demand.

Again, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòforeign education‚Äô. ‚ÄúAre we gonna pretend that race based school system isn‚Äôt the main thing dividing our country‚Äù. No man it‚Äôs not the main thing.
