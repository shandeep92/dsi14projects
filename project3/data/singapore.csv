Sometimes it will only feel wet or damp when the source of the water damage is occurring such as when it rains or when your above neighbour uses their water for an extended period of time (washing/showering etc).

"Hello! I'm in the same position as you, still serving and just got started on investing! Just opened my CDP account and awaiting my brokerage account to get activated so i can get started, as i'm already eyeing a few stocks. For me, i didn't really specifically do anything. Instead, i just read up everything i could about investing and learnt from my friends+parents. Pertaining to your post, since you wanna go the 'easy' way (low risk, low return), maybe you can consider investing in an ETF? Just put some money in it each month, and by the power of compound interest, it can yield you some pretty amazing results 20-30 years down the road. But of course, this option will yield relatively lower returns than if you played individual stocks. But what you SHOULD do is definitely go and do your own research! This applies even if you are planning to do passive investing (i.e just put an amount of money in every month), as different brokers/banks charge different transaction fees, which can sneakily eat into your returns if you transact frequently.

"Just something to chew on: if you have sufficient liquid savings right now and aren't in dire need of cash, you should consider topping up your CPF OA or SA account! The first 50k in CPF has an additional 1% interest, so the total rates of 3.5% (OA) or 5% (SA) easily beats whatever you can get from STI ETF or roboadvisors. Plus, this is risk-free too. The major downside is that you won't have access to this cash until you start paying off your student/housing loan for OA, and until retirement age for SA. Hence, the caveats above. Edit: This tip is probably more applicable when you're working, but I just had to leave this here as CPF is a really underrated tool for those with no experience in investing.",1589346419,fqghim0,t3_giq3ox,1,singapore,131

"Some alternative advice more pertaining to mindset. Take your time to just digest it for now. There is no immediate rush to do anything with it. You have plenty of time. Don't feel obligated to make the 'best' use if it. The thing is, when money comes from a loved one's loss of life, it feels like spending it 'appropriately' is the only way to properly 'live up' to it. That's impossible. Nothing will ever be good enough so don't worry too much about it. Seriously. Even if you invest it in a magic beanstalk overnight and turn it into $100 million and give it to the exact right person who uses it to cure Covid19. So what? It won't feel enough so don't look at it as a void to fill. Also, putting perspective into the amount of $10k. It's an amount someone can make in year (fully, gainfully employed). It's also an amount that can tide someone unemployed over, for a year (many assumptions here with omission of rent, but you get my drift).Look at how soon you'll be in a stage of life where that'll be the case for you. Because once you hit that, the amount has less meaning for you. Even if you want to do something frivolous like buying a $10k watch. In big picture it doesn't matter if you spend the $10k you made and saved over the year, or the $10k that was in your bank the whole time from this payout. Thinking otherwise just induces some kind of spending paralysis on you for the rest of your life. I share this from personal experience, where I got incredibly lucky from an 'investment opportunity' that never should have worked out from a very young age, and although it's nowhere close to the same as obtaining it from a life payout, I've had the same feelings of trying to 'live up' to spending it wisely. It's sat in my bank (coming to 10 years) uninvested ever since and I've lived most of my life as if it never existed. I appreciate the sometimes overly frugal habits that I've developed because of it, but at some point I learnt money is money and significance of where it came from and what you do with it is only what you assign to it. And spending it like a normal human being or consumer, isn't as bad as what those FIRE movement min-maxers would tell you.",1589346032,fqggzpt,t3_giq3ox,1,singapore,410

"Advice to stop lying to colleagues and feeling scared while working. I was newly employed as full time on first April I tot this job was ideal for me since it was similar to what I have worked as an intern. Unfortunately I was quite wrong as there were many components to rmb. So my issue now is I have the tendency to say I have completed all the steps, and they found out I didn't everything which is quite serious (this has happened many times on different occasions). I feel very bad for them and annoyed at myself because I feel incompetent while continuously lying and could have messed up somewhere if they didn't check on me. Feels terribly bad today cuz my colleague sound quite angsty when I approach her. I wish I can be honest to them and myself but when being questioned I feel pressurized and hence lied my way through.. Additionally, I realize when I say I didn't do / not knowing those few steps vs when I lie, it still ended myself being reprimanded cuz they would blame me for not asking which is really suffocating. So how do I cope with this bad habit? Do I apologize to them? Do I just be thick skin and straight up say I didn't do and just get scolded as usual (could be better than lying I guess)?",1589344759,fqgf8uf,t3_gilizf,-1,singapore,232

"&gt; # Judge rejects plea by woman who allowed customer into salon for massage and masturbation &gt; SINGAPORE: A woman accused of allowing a customer into her salon for massage and masturbation during the ""circuit breaker"" period had her guilty plea rejected on Wednesday (May 13) after she could not stop crying in court. &gt; Jin Yin, 55, was set to plead guilty to charges related to an incident on Apr 10, when she allowed a 67-year-old man into her In-Style Beauty Salon opposite the State Courts on Apr 10. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; There, she allegedly provided massage and masturbation services to him for S$150. &gt; However, Jin repeatedly sobbed and wailed in court on Wednesday until District Judge Ong Hian Sun said he would have to reject her plea as he felt she was not in the right frame of mind to plead guilty. &gt; The judge had stood down the case twice for Jin to compose herself, but she continued sobbing despite the interpreter coaxing her. &gt; Several security officers were also consoling her in court. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; When Jin heard that the prosecution was asking for a S$21,000 fine, she dropped to her knees and began begging for mercy, kowtowing and saying she could not afford it. &gt; She said she had only S$3,000 left and a daughter in Beijing to raise. She also said that she committed the offences only because of the debts she incurred after her mother contracted cancer. &gt; Jin was told that she could serve a jail term in lieu of the fine if she could not pay it. &gt; She asked how long it would be, but the judge replied that he was not prepared to decide that at this stage of the proceeding. &gt; At this, Jin began wailing again, saying ""what about my daughter"" and was given a chair to sit down. &gt; The judge rejected her plea and adjourned the case to a pre-trial conference later this month. &gt; For not keeping her premises closed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations, she can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000 or both. &gt; For each charge of carrying out an unlicensed massage business and advertising it, she can be jailed for up to two years, fined a maximum S$10,000 or both. Jin also faces enhanced punishments as she was previously convicted of similar offences, her charge sheets stated. &gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589343816,fqgdxcg,t3_girth5,5,singapore,437

"I preemptively removed my wisdom teeth so they just check my teeth then I was done during the FFI. I don't know how the current covid situation has affected getting a wisdom teeth removal appointment but I'll just give you my suggestion. I suggest you get your teeth checked before the FFI as you might not be able to go through the entire wisdom teeth removal process before you ord. Had a few platoon mates missed the opportunity to remove their wisdom teeth as their FFI was too late. So they did not have enough time to make the relevant appointments to remove their teeth. To get your teeth checked before your FFI you can either make an appointment with a polyclinic (need to pay for initial appointment,not covered with 11B) or ask your S1 clerk to help you make an appointment with an in-camp medical center. I made an appointment with the polyclinic as the earliest medical center appointment was like 1 month later than the earliest polyclinic appointment. They will then check ur teeth and if they require removal they will refer you to a hospital for further check ups.",1589342565,fqgc2rd,t1_fqfy453,1,singapore,192

"This is ridiculous. do we no longer have any propensity for patience? Some people are brought up in an environment where such language is common and probably the lowest level of aggression. I don’t agree that it should’ve been used but was police action really necessary? His wife continued to work despite not being an essential worker (most likely because they cannot are POOR?) and he is a cleaner. Obviously it’s a sensitive time and the couple is probably facing financial trouble. Being told to go home (I agree that the Sade distancing enforcement officer has to do so), the wife must feel very stressed and the husband will feel protective and provoked. He didn’t execute any form of violence or intent to cause hurt right? So why involve police action? Why financially punish them? Could it not have been solved with dialogue first? Did they even try? Why call the police STRAIGHT AWAY? Is this how we treat the people in the lower end of our economy?

"Yeah the Botanic Gardens are hardly a natural setting though. You're talking about a bunch of large fishes trapped in small waterbodies, without much aquatic vegetation or hiding places. And koi have been selectively bred for centuries to be much more conspicuous compared to their wild counterparts. No wonder they're such easy targets. A wild fish-eating animal would have to be stupid to not take advantage of this opportunity. In the reservoirs and canals, the fishes have much more room to swim around and escape. Otters have to expend more energy hunting in these places, and after some time, the fishes become too dispersed and too challenging to catch, so the otters move on to another area in their territory. In the meantime, the fishes reproduce and replenish their numbers, so it's really unlikely that the otters will ever become so abundant that they wipe out their prey. Instead, the presence of predators like otters is a sign that the ecosystem is healthy enough to support the prey required for them to thrive.",1589341865,fqgb016,t1_fqdws0b,1,singapore,173

"Take this all with a grain of salt. I'm certainly not familiar enough with the cultural nuances, how much has carried over internationally, and how it may be changing with the new generations to know for sure, but it makes some sense at least on a surface level I had read some article a while back (which I can't seem to find) describing the role of Chinese/Confucian [guanxi \[wikipedia\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanx) in influencing how relationships are viewed. There's a heavy emphasis on reciprocal favors/services/obligation and standing, developing and maintaining a network of connections to call upon. It can shift the view of relationships, at least in part, from ""I like/dislike your company"" to ""I see what you can potentially do for/against me"". As a result, a high status person might court a low*er* status person with potential, but wouldn't care to befriend a *low* status person since both what they can ""contribute"" and the possibility of significantly rising in status is low. Similarly, the low status person will continue to be respectful of the high status person (or at least keep their head down) to avoid possible repercussions. Based on my very limited understanding, I think the philosophy has a noble end goal - a strong community support network, building and maintaining trust, helping others and asking for help. I can see how the the specific self/own-family focused means and incentives to get there - coupled with a strong sense of hierarchy and drive for tangible success - can sometimes lead to results that I don't personally agree with.",1589341788,fqgavrc,t1_fqg3r3w,2,singapore,257

She was outside Hougang Mall selling headscarves and waiting for a customer when she was told to leave. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; Her husband Abdul Halim Adi, 48, pleaded guilty to one charge of using abusive words on a safe distancing enforcement officer. &gt; The incident occurred at about 1pm on Apr 14 this year, during the ""circuit breaker"" period when most businesses were ordered to close and people were urged to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. &gt; The victim, a 32-year-old HDB officer deployed as a safe distancing enforcement officer, was carrying out his work when he saw Abdul Halim's wife outside Hougang Mall. &gt; She was waiting to hand a headscarf to a customer, and was carrying on a business outside her home when she was not an essential service provider, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; The officer walked towards the woman, but she left when she spotted him. &gt; The officer entered the mall and spotted the woman about 15 minutes later. He told her to go home, and she said she would do so. &gt; However, the woman instead went to look for her husband, who was at the basement level of the mall near a supermarket. &gt; She told Abdul Halim that the safe distancing officer had been following her and had told her to go home. &gt; At this point, the officer walked past the couple. Abdul Halim saw the officer and his pass, knowing that he was enforcing safe distancing measures. &gt; Displeased by the victim's directions to his wife, Abdul Halim hurled Hokkien vulgarities at him and said ""why did you harass my wife"". &gt; The victim did not engage the pair, instead walking away and calling the police immediately. &gt; There were about 10 to 15 passers-by at the time, with some stopping to watch. &gt; The prosecutor asked for a fine of at least S$3,500, noting that enforcement officers tasked with performing ""difficult jobs of patrolling and safeguarding public health in the COVID-19 circuit breaker period"" must be protected. &gt; ""That being said, while general deterrence is the operative sentencing principle, here, the outburst was short and impulsive, and the crowd was thin, even if it was unwarranted,"" said Ms Wong. &gt; She added that Abdul Halim did not have previous related convictions, and that there was no evidence of him continuing to be aggressive. &gt; The judge allowed Abdul Halim to pay his fine in instalments by mid-November. &gt; For using abusive words on a safe distancing officer carrying out his duty, he could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both. &gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589340880,fqg9h41,t3_gir364,3,singapore,534

"&gt; # Forum: Pet industry stands to benefit from a negative list of animals &gt; Deregulation of the pet industry in Singapore is needed for its immediate diversification and growth. &gt; A negative list of injurious, dangerous and invasive groups of animals should be created, and those that are not listed should be allowed. &gt; Many of the largest pet industries in the world work on the basis of such a negative list. &gt; The pet trade in Singapore is based on a positive list, whereby any species not listed is deemed illegal. &gt; Such a practice has been very damaging to an industry that is diverse and has unlimited potential. Entrepreneurial spirit is killed because for new pets to be legalised, proposals need to be submitted and many meetings have to be held. And if a species is legalised, this would benefit not only the entrepreneur who submitted the proposals, but also his competitors. &gt; The current legislation against certain groups of animals - such as insects, reptiles and most other cold-blooded animals - unfortunately hints at speciesism, whereby these groups of animals are considered unimportant. &gt; Ideal pet species in a high-density urban setting are those that can be contained on personal property, which lowers the risk of any disease spread to the community. &gt; Pets that do not disturb the peace in the community should be promoted. &gt; Dogs, cats and birds make up the majority of complaints due to noise or other forms of public disturbance such as scent marking. &gt; Cold-blooded animals including frogs or geckos are easily contained in enclosures, and are much better choices to be companion animals, as they are far less likely to spread severe diseases to humans compared with conventional warm-blooded pets. &gt; In choosing a pet, consideration should be given to minimise inconvenience to others living in close proximity. &gt; Ong Junkai --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589340757,fqg9a4p,t3_gir20d,1,singapore,320

"Great that you've decided to advocate for yourself and seek help! :) I suffered from anxiety disorder due to residua PTSD shortly after moving back to Singapore a couple of years ago from Europe (where mental health is very unstigmatised and there is a broad range of therapeutic services to choose from). Knowing that private practices here are incredibly expensive I thought it would be sensible to request a polyclinic referral to IMH, since they claim to offer talk therapy/counselling (which I what I was looking for anyway) for a fraction of the cost. It was a huge mistake. The service was incredibly indiscreet (yelling my name across the reception lobby?), brusque and frankly upsetting. Not gentle with the more vulnerable patients (those strapped to chairs and beds) at all. The therapist in question turned out to be a psychiatrist, who interrupted me after 10 minutes and asked if I needed more sleeping pills (???). She said the most important thing was to take meds and address the physical symptoms of anxiety first before going into the counselling part which unfortunately, I really disagree with. Meds can be incredibly helpful when it comes to treating mental health but I would never start a course without a doctor I trust and who doesn't already know my situation inside-out. As impractical as it sounds, I ended up Skypeing in with my former therapist from abroad simply because it felt like a safer environment for me. This was a couple of years ago. I'm much better now and no longer require therapy (yay!) and have been told of many affordable/pro bono/sliding scale services that have been popping up in SG since. I believe there was a pretty comprehensive list floating around on Instagram via [""@asha.n.co](mailto:""@asha.n.co)"" Most importantly, if you can afford to, know it's okay to shop around for a therapist until you find one you're most comfortable with! Apart from support, talk therapy is rightly supposed to challenge you (e.g. on your own patterns and biases), but anyone who belittles you or makes you second-guess yourself is a no -- no matter how affordable their services are. (Therapists who dispense advice like ""You should do or say this"" etc. are also frowned upon in most psychological circles.)

He was served with an SHN for the period from March 17 to 31. &gt; Instead of proceeding to his declared place of residence in Sembawang Drive, he took public transport to Marina Bay Sands where he worked as a security officer. &gt; After he left work on March 18, he took public transport to his company’s lodging at Dunlop Street where he shared a room with three co-workers. &gt; He also continued to commute to work daily between March 19 and 21. &gt; The Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) discovered his breach of SHN on March 21 when enforcement officers visited his declared place of residence in Sembawang Drive and found that he was not there. &gt; Azhar Bin Khamis &gt; Azhar arrived in Singapore from Batam, Indonesia, on March 26, 2020, and was served with an SHN for the period from March 26 to Apr. 9, 2020. &gt; Instead of proceeding to his declared place of residence in Tampines, he spent the night at his sister’s residence in Serangoon. &gt; He left his sister’s residence on March 27 and spent the next few days in public areas at Harbourfront. &gt; ICA enforcement officers visited his declared place of residence in Tampines on Apr. 5 and found that he was not there. He was discovered at the Singapore Cruise Centre later that day. &gt; Zahari Bin Samat &gt; Zahari arrived in Singapore from Batam, Indonesia, on Apr. 1, 2020 and was served with an SHN for the period from Apr. 1 to Apr. 15. &gt; He had proceeded to a rented address at North Bridge Road, which was not his declared place of accommodation at Ang Mo Kio. &gt; Zahari went to the ICA Building on Apr. 2 to inform an officer that he had provided an outdated address in his electronic health declaration and intended to update the address where he would serve his SHN. &gt; He was advised to return to his place of accommodation at North Bridge Road immediately. However, on Apr. 8, he left his place of accommodation again and was arrested by CNB officers at an open air carpark nearby. &gt; ICA has investigated the breaches &gt; ICA has investigated these three individuals’ wilful breaches of SHN requirements. &gt; Quresh will be charged under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act, while Azhar and Zahari will be charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 – Stay Orders) Regulations 2020. &gt; A person convicted of an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act and its Regulations is liable to a fine of up to S$10,000, or up to six months’ imprisonment, or both. &gt; SHN requirements &gt; With effect from March 16, 2020, 11:59pm, all residents, Long-Term Pass (LTP) holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore with travel history to any ASEAN country within the previous 14 days would be issued an SHN and must remain in their place of residence at all times for a 14-day period. &gt; From March 20, 2020, 11:59pm, these requirements were extended to all residents, LTP holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore. &gt; Further measures were put in place from Apr. 9 requiring all residents, LTP holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore to serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated facilities. &gt; Top photo via Google Maps, MBS/FB --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589338229,fqg57e0,t3_giqeot,2,singapore,646

"&gt; # M1 fibre broadband outage hits thousands of users &gt; Thousands of M1 fibre broadband users around Singapore were left without Internet access for more than 17 hours yesterday during a time when subscribers need to work and study from home amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. &gt; M1's disruption, which comes one month after StarHub's intermittent outage, was still not resolved as of 10pm yesterday. &gt; According to the Downdetector website, which logs Internet outages, M1 started having problems around 4.30am, before complaints spiked at 9am with around 1,500 reports. &gt; On its Facebook page, M1 first reported the problem at 8am, noting that customers in some areas in the western, central and eastern parts of Singapore were affected, and that its engineers were working hard to resolve the issue. &gt; Many netizens said that northern Singapore was affected as well. &gt; In an update at 7.30pm, M1 said its engineers had identified and isolated the issue causing disruptions to the affected group of customers. &gt; It did not say what the issue was. &gt; Accounts officer Carol Tan, who lives in Jurong West Street 61, was still waiting for her fibre broadband connection to resume more than four hours after it first stopped working at about 7.45am. &gt; ""It's quite hard for us without broadband as we are all heavy (Internet) users. My husband and I are deaf, and we rely on the Internet a lot to update ourselves on what's happening outside,"" said the 45-year-old, who has two teenage children. &gt; ""My son also has an online class soon and we will have to see what happens."" &gt; Life coach Joseph Kalai, 45, noticed his broadband connection speed slowing to less than 100Mbps - a tenth of the 1Gbps he pays for - on Monday. &gt; ""I still had a connection but I read about the situation (yesterday) and for some reason decided to restart my router around 11am. Since then, no Internet,"" said Mr Kalai, who lives in the east. &gt; ""I think there was already some issue since Monday but no one picked up on it."" &gt; Mr Lim Jing Hong, who works in financial services, told The Straits Times that he normally starts work around 7am and could not get his connection to work at 6.55am. &gt; The 32-year-old, who lives in Marsiling, said: ""I could not verify if it was my router, personal connection, or M1's connection that was having problems... &gt; ""I only verified after getting through the hotline more than 30 minutes later. &gt; ""I thought communication (from the telco) was severely lacking. I missed morning meetings today, (and) had to arrange for other colleagues to cover my duties."" &gt; Last month, two network service disruptions on the same day affected thousands of StarHub subscribers, and were attributed to network equipment failure and a domain name server issue. &gt; Addressing the issue of network capacity in Parliament last week, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran said Internet usage in Singapore remains well within network operators' capacity despite a spike in traffic during the circuit breaker period. --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589338227,fqg578u,t3_giqejn,1,singapore,522

Otherwise, going for public options like restructured general hospital is the best. IMH used to be for ""everyone"" but now it seems to be populated with too many serious cases, and all serious cases which restructured general hospital can't/don't handle, goes there. I checked with the psychiatrist at my previous review, and there are indeed ward options for mental patients in the hospital. So no need to go to IMH or think of IMH as the only choice. Imo, given my personal experience... I would say that IMH only go if you are at serious risk of immediate self harm or a public risk. Until then, let the GP, polyclinic or the psych ward at restructure hospitals evaluate you first. It will be a far better experience, and you will actually get more help. Instead of being locked up for your own safety, cause they don't know what to do (That's IMH)",1589337814,fqg4iwj,t3_gi3st5,2,singapore,251

"I've worked in the service line and I can say this goes both ways... It goes both ways really, what gets measured gets done. There is an incentive to be nice to customers; they'll come back , and they won't complain about your shitty attitude. On the flip side, delivery people are essentially self-employed. There isn't a metric on how they should be treated and how good/bad treatment of delivery riders will provide any kind of tangible incentive. Considering they'll see many different faces of delivery riders, many times a day, some new some old, it really doesn't pay to be extra nice. The whole situation played out for me during a mother's day collection of food. The grabfood application apparently can't be switched off, so it rang consistently. The tzechar stall's kitchen was infuriated because they simply couldn't rush the orders, while the delivery riders were constantly asking if their order is done. It's an entire fault with the system where the rider is at a disadvantage because there's no point in either side (restaurant or grab) being ""nice"" to the riders. They're ""self-employed"" under this platform, getting paid probably better than any available jobs to them, and there's a huge ready supply of riders.",1589333163,fqfwn2e,t3_gigsv3,2,singapore,206

"&gt; # COVID-19: Singapore records 3rd straight day of single-digit community cases &gt; SINGAPORE: New COVID-19 cases in the community remained in the single digits for the third consecutive day on Tuesday (May 12), the first time since Singapore entered its “circuit breaker” period. &gt; Four community cases were reported on Tuesday, comprising three Singaporeans and one work pass holder. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; There were three community cases on Monday, and four on Sunday. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Singapore implemented a slew of circuit breaker measures from Apr 7 to curb the spread of COVID-19, including closing most non-essential workplaces and moving schools to full home-based learning. &gt; Additional social distancing measures were also set in place for services that were allowed to remain open, including food and beverage outlets and supermarkets. &gt; Advertisement &gt; Advertisement &gt; The circuit breaker period was originally scheduled to end on May 4, but has since been extended to Jun 1. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The authorities also made it mandatory on Apr 14 for residents to wear masks outside of their homes. &gt; Several people have been fined for breaching safe distancing rules and not wearing a mask in public. &gt; REDUCING COMMUNITY INFECTIONS &gt; Singapore's circuit breaker restrictions have “shown promise” in reducing COVID-19 infections in the community, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in a multi-ministry task force press conference on Tuesday. &gt; The average number of daily community cases has fallen from 30 cases in late-April to eight in the past week, said Mr Gan. &gt; However, he also cautioned that the number could rise again as restrictions are gradually lifted. &gt; “As we gradually lift the circuit breaker measures, there is a risk that the community cases may rise again. This has been the experience of many countries which have seen a second wave of infections after relaxing their social distancing measures,” he said. &gt; On May 5, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners were allowed to resume acupuncture treatments for pain management, and medical halls linked to TCM outlets were also allowed to sell retail products. &gt; On Tuesday, home-based food businesses, hair salons and selected food retail outlets and food manufacturing firms were allowed to resume operations. &gt; Mr Gan added that Singapore has to remain “very careful, remain vigilant and minimise the risk of any sharp rise in cases, or large clusters in the community”. &gt; Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said in a Facebook post after the press conference that there have been requests for the relaxation of some measures, especially the restriction on visiting family. &gt; This, however, must be “considered very carefully” to ensure the safety of seniors, who are particularly vulnerable if they contract COVID-19, he said. &gt; Singapore had a total of 24,671 COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday, most of them foreign workers. &gt; Another 626 patients were discharged on Tuesday, a new daily high. &gt; On Sunday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 33 “false positive” cases after one of the laboratories experienced an “apparatus calibration issue” with one of its test kits. &gt; Two other cases, which initially had equivocal results, were also confirmed to be negative upon re-testing. &gt; Of these, three were from the community. &gt; These ""false positive"" cases were discovered as a result of a quality assurance programme put in place to check on test results, said MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak at the press conference on Tuesday. &gt; Authorities are giving the lab time to properly recalibrate and revalidate its test kits as well as work through its ""quality assurance processes"", he said. &gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589332077,fqfuqoe,t3_giorbh,2,singapore,633

"What you're highlighting isn't nessecarily STEM education. Here is an article by CNA that discusses it [link here](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/stem-arts-and-humanities-coronavirus-education-university-degree-12713556#.XrojXeMImiE.facebook) 'It might seem obvious Singaporeans should increase our longstanding focus on STEM, given the pandemic’s origins and solutions in these fields.' But when Germany is reopening, 'Philosophers, historians, theologians, jurists and pedagogical experts outnumbered scientists and medical specialists on an advisory group convened to decide reopening issues relating to ethics, law, human and social behavior, political power and the role of government in balancing the needs of health, the environment and the economy' On complaints and the need to understand scientific research and whatnot, STEM education isn't the way for people to be understanding. We can have the best mix of education in the world but still be ignorant on important issues. This can be achieved through critical thought, or maybe, the understanding of human nature(?). The solution to such things might not be so clear cut. There are many views on 'what might be important next time because of this', and i would agree with the article that arts and humanities will be much more important in the future than now, in Singapore.

"There are actually 3 different types of DNA tests, the one that tells you whatever % of a certain ethnicity you are is called an atDNA (autosomal DNA) test, other than that there is also a Y-DNA (paternal lineage) test and an mtDNA (maternal lineage) test, both of which assigns you to a haplogroup which shows that you are descended from a single male / female ancestor in which that mutation occurred, and interestingly certain haplogroups are also more closely associated with certain ethnicities. For example, Y-DNA Haplogroup O2-M134 or O2-M117 is closely associated with Han Chinese from the Central Plains, whereas Y-DNA Haplogroup O1-M119, or O1-M95 suggests ancestry from the indigenous ethnic minorities of Southern China with closer ties to Southeast Asians (eg Tai-Kadai / Thai / Lao / Zhuang, Austro-Asiatic / Khmer / Vietnamese, Austronesian / Malay / Filipino) While autosomal DNA tests for recent ancestry dating back only a few hundred years and results differ from company to company depending on their population reference database (hence it is less accurate and largely subjective), the Y-DNA and mtDNA tests are objective and far more accurate, haplogroups you are assigned to will not change at all no matter which company you test with and is used to trace ancestry back thousands of years along your paternal or maternal line. 23andMe tests for all 3 (atDNA, Y-DNA, mtDNA), and from my experience with them customer service was prompt and swift. I'll assume this new CircleDNA test only tests for autosomal DNA, and it's absurdly expensive in comparison to 23andMe. No point taking this CircleDNA test (which I think is from Hong Kong??), I'd say just go for 23andMe.",1589330586,fqfs2ej,t1_fesd0zf,1,singapore,278

Cannot stand for hrs since and does not have a perm job since NSF. Even doing office work, I also scream when phone ring/ compouter make noise/ door open etc. [https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/non-epileptic-seizures](https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/non-epileptic-seizures) My symptons: difficulty breathing, screaming for a few seconds when startled easily by loud noises/ physical contact, heart palapatuions, seizures which can last for hrs. I waS downgraded from PES A / B to PES C due to GAD seizures. After NS, The polyclinic doctor directed me to IMH (no choice) as I wanted a perm excuse for excuse range (PES C MO only gave me a temp 7 weeks excuse for PES C BMT only). There were a few times that they gave injections in the midst of seizures. I was warded twice for one day each due to the public calling ambulance because of my anxiety attacks outside. I hate the experience because onced my symptons of seizures and breathing subside, I can walk again. IMH has job club (with occupatuional therapists as intermediarey and point of contact) that has employers hiring people with mental health issues (unsure about SGH and NUH). They only have manual labour employes though which I cannot do -cannot stand for long hrs without seizures due to NSF . I was dismissed from IMH job club because of my seizures at IMH/ client's premises when due to sign contract. The communiy wellness ctr which they may route mental health patients to depending on patients' location improved now,. I used to see different drs every time at cwc but now only one dr now. For psychologists, my first is a doctorate PHd (Senior psychologist) so more expensive . Psychologist (title) with masters is more affordable. I am on comcare since 2013 (Dr at IMH certified me unfit for work yearly) The mediation changed a lot over the years. MY medication is fluoxetine, quetiapine and Mirtszapine now. Seeing psychologist to talk about things is complimentary to just popping medication and hoping that thing can automativcall y be better.

"Yes this right here. As a rider I've gotten my fair share of restaurants who act deaf when we ask questions. Even simple questions like ""Is all the food inside?"" cos some places like to just dump completed orders on a table without tying the bag up or any indication that the food was done. Or start shouting at us the moment we put one foot into their shop even though the order is already sitting there waiting to be taken, and no staff seems to realise we've already reached. Wait outside the restaurant we're invisible. Call for staff also no one want to respond. But one foot in restaurant suddenly we become very visible to them alr. But serve walk-in customers suddenly all sunshine and rainbows. I've made it a point to inform customers when restaurants are excessively and consistently rude to riders - let the customers decide for themselves whether they want to support such behaviours from restaurants. To be fair, there are some very nice restaurants with amazing staff (I've posted the exceptional ones here before), but there're also those that're really bad. Best case scenario they treat us as nonexistent, worst case they attempt verbal and physical agression to get us out of their store. EDIT: Grab riders - you can report any aggression from restaurants by going to Help Centre &gt; Report a Serious Incident, then select the ""Merchant"" option. It's a very short form, and you'll get a call back from Grab's investigation team within 5 minutes. Based on what I gathered the last time I called in, they're empowered to shut down a restaurant and cancel all orders if the situation gets too out of hand. If you see another rider involved in an altercation with a restaurant that could get ugly, do fill in that form but make it clear that you're not involved but another rider is.

The authorities understand this desire to be physically connected again, he said. &gt; ""While we would like to allow them to see one another... we have to be quite cautious in moving on such a measure. &gt; ""Particularly when it comes to the elderly, because we all know that they are vulnerable, and if they were to catch the virus, the disease is potentially lethal for them."" &gt; Mr Wong was speaking at a virtual press conference yesterday. &gt; Meanwhile, the Health Ministry announced 884 new cases in Singapore, taking its tally past 24,000. Three of the new cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents. &gt; Singapore's circuit breaker measures came into force on April 7 and were to last till May 4. &gt; They were later extended by a month to June 1. &gt; As part of moves to curb the Covid-19 spread, all social gatherings with friends and family members who do not live in the same household have had to stop. &gt; People, however, can still visit their elderly relatives if these seniors need help with daily needs. &gt; However, they have to take precautions, such as observing personal hygiene, minimising physical contact and not visiting if one is unwell. &gt; Toh Wen Li --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1589329155,fqfpfsy,t3_ginxi2,1,singapore,311
