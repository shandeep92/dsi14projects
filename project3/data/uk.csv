"And for a further example of PHE questionable stances, take a look at the public spat between PHE and the Resuscitation Council UK. Initially, PHE seems to have taken the stance that chest compressions where an Aerosol Generating Procedure, thus full PPE required. This resulted in a brief flurry of comments that that would mean that nurses on the wards would need to put on PPE before starting CPR, with quotes to ""There is no Emergency in a Pandemic"". This provoked something of a backlash and PHE quickly issued a clarification that Chest Compressions are not aerosol generating. Then the actually authority on life support stepped in, The Resus Council UK, who's word is the law when it comes to resuscitation. They put out an updated algorithm requiring full PPE for chest compressions, advising that defib pads could be placed on the patient in the interim, but staff should get into full PPE before starting compressions. This resulted in a public 'argument' on twitter between PHE and RCUK, with PHE trying to justifying its stance by fishing out Scotish NHS white paper which largely depended upon this suspect Tran et al (2012) study. Its probably no fault of the Scottish NHS, someone was probably asked to do a rapid review and wasnt very thorough. What is deeply suspect is that PHE didnt critically appraise the evidence they were using, convenient how it supported their position isnt it? Eventually, PHE conceded to RCUK and got back in its box regarding chest compressions. But then NERVTAG published its rapid review (and guess what Tran et al (2012) reared its head again (though they at least do consider other studies too), and the advice shifted yet again. As you can imagine this has left healthcare staff in a difficult position, who's guidance should they follow? This already comes at a sensitive time regarding resuscitation e.g. there was a care home nurse who was sanctioned by the NMC for not performing CPR on a corpse, not someone just keeled over, an actual corpse. Of course there is the priviso, your not dead until your warm and dead, but when faced with someone who's at the end of their life, who is now waxy, cold, stiff and definitely not breathing and who hasnt been immersed in a cold lake, perhaps the right thing to do is to grant that person some dignity rather than breaking their ribs.

"I haven't looked into it but typically the nukes provide between 25 to 30ish% of the total UK power when all are operational. UK currently has 8(?) Nuke sites so you'd need 3 times that amount I guess? The real problem is demand isn't consistent and nukes operate best as a consistent baseline load. You don't want to be raising and lowering the load on a nuke to match demand. Gas sites are perfect for demand spikes as they can be synchronised within 30 minutes I think, definitely less than an hour. From what I remember there's only 4 sites that are being or were planned to be built on, one of which was being driven by Horizon nuclear which is currently mothballed.

"big ass load of metal spinning inside of some magnets generates electricity, it has energy intrinsic due to its motion, if suddenly there is a heavier demand on the grid the grid will draw more energy from this large mass slowing it down, giving time for more steam to be made and pushed through the turbines to compensate. allowing the grid to essentially have a variable ammount of demand.

"Basically you get a known supply of power that you can reasonably rely on from coal, gas, Nuclear etc. You want X amount of energy from those sources? You get X amount of energy because all you need to do is contact the power stations and have them meet the required limits. With solar or wind energy you get whatever the weather permits, which can be high it can be low and it can vary all over the place from minute to minute. So while renewable like solar and wind is vastly more preferable to coal or gas it is also much less reliable. The key to solving this would be efficient long term battery storage, that way on your surplus days you could store the excess energy and then on your deficit days you can tap into that battery power. That field is advancing but its not quite there yet. Though one method that has been used for years is to take excess energy and use it to pump water into reservoirs, then at times of high demand you open those reservoirs up and let them drive hydro-electric power stations.

"Nuclear power consumes very little fuel. Unlike a coal or gas power plant that literally sets its fuel on fire to heat something, nuclear power relies on heat that comes from the controlled splitting of uranium atoms, which turns them into lighter atoms and releases heat and radiation.

Also uranium is actually really common - you can find it all across the world. Recent developments have even meant that we might be able to use what we currently consider to be spent fuel.

And you only needed to look at the constant news stories with photos of hundreds of people in Regent's Park not following social distancing to see they were millienials. I wonder how many people have died due to these people? Will millennials answer collectively for this as you lot expect all boomers to answer for their sins?

Whilst I agree, there is more to be learnt, there is increasing evidence of the epidemiology of the disease considering there’s been more than 4 million confirmed cases world-wide. There’s already a proposed model for the relative reduced risk in children that is being investigated. Children will have to return to school before a vaccine or effective treatment will be found, that is an almost certainty. There is good evidence that children are at reduced risk, the area that is much more debatable and does need more research is how good they are at spreading the disease and whether they transmit (and to what extent) the virus when asymptomatic.

I really hope the move to more smart meters and smart homes in general help this shift (current privacy issues aside - the main reason I'm not automating more of my home right now). If people can see on a dashboard how much energy they're using they can visualise it like a tap which is a good analogy. Combine this with smart learning and the automated systems will turn on devices when they're needed. The end user will notice no difference but the appliance will be off more. The people I know using smart home heating definitely heat their home for less time than they used to with a static system. Your portable rig sounds pretty cool and like a fun project to get into off-grid life. One day I dream about that option. When mobile internet is more reliable I think I could definitely see myself moving further away from cities with an off-grid lifestyle. Particularly if work from home doesn't go away fully. I expect for some industries the return to office work will never be the same. Companies will realise the cost they can save on infastructure providing the productivity doesn't slack too much.

"We'll continue to reduce consumption by individual devices as technology progresses, but I guess this will be offset by more technology per household.

Unfortunately, the things where high wattage is still advertised can't really change. Can you imagine boiling water at 400w rather than 1500-2000?

"1. Less than half of the students will be returning. Specifically reception, year 1 and year 6. That means you can loose up to 50% of the support staff, though teachers will be spread thin. 2. Those that are available should help. Remaining shortfall can be made up of student teachers, teaching assistants and remaining teachers from years 2,3,4 and 5. If the situation becomes critical, see if you can get some secondary teachers in on temporarily or something. 3. Give them a chair and tell them to sit on it. It may not work all the time, but with constant reinforcement it'd be good enough to function. 4. As mentioned, with less than half of the students returning, half of the teachers are now available for tasking. That should cover the immediate shortfall and have enough to crease a small reserve. 5. I've no real answer for this one. I think PPE should be prioritised for medical staff rather than educational staff, but if they want to buy their own that's up to them. 6. The teachers are the valuable ones in this situation, the support staff are secondary. There being less kids in general will reduce the load on the support staff, but the decrease in class size will keep the teachers spread thin. And, not to sound too apathetic, the main requirement for a lunchtime supervisor is a DBS check. They shouldn't be too hard to hire in. 7. That can be handled with appropriate signage.

"Non-renewables won't run out. We've got hundreds of years worth of coal reserves under our feet in the UK, even if we went back to full reliance on coal power. But we won't, and have been phasing it out for decades, because it's filthy. Who was it who shut the coal mines again btw? As renewables - there's still a long way to go and we're leading the way. We can get a lot of our electricity from renewables when the conditions are right. Unfortunately, sometimes they aren't, and there's no clear answer. Wind doesn't always blow, it's often dark, tidal is an environmental disaster, and storage options are prohibitively expensive (for now). So that's where nuclear comes in. It relies on non-renewable fuel, but we could power the whole planet on nuclear and not have to worry about running out. It creates no pollution aside from spent fuel, which is easily dealt with (though admittedly an expensive and complex task), is extremely reliable, incredibly safe, and aside from construction costs, almost free. The issue is, as you hint at, the construction costs are enormous, but you cannot put a price on the future of humanity. Look at the current situation as a prime example. If you dismiss the fucking around from successive governments, Hinckley Point C will have gone from breaking ground to generating electricity in five years. Get some Chinese investment in, do some deals, we could get 10 built before 2030. That would be everything we'd need, and ZERO reliance on fossil fuels. Then, as we'd have massive amounts of almost free electricity, move all long-distance lorry freight to rail freight - interestingly this is what people miss about HS2. Yes, it is utterly insane and stupid to spend that much money on cutting a train journey from London to Birmingham by 15 minutes, but it frees up the existing lines for freight.

Personally, I believe in order to reduce the instability of the peaks, the government should reinstate grant's to encourage more solar or small scale wind generation, paired with storage where possible. Having a decent percentage of households with storage would take pressure off at peak times. It would be an expensive scheme for the government to fund, but would show a real commitment to clean energy. The interesting energy figures will start to emerge when electric vehicles become more prominent over the next few years.

"&gt;A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis estimates that it will cost the Exchequer almost £300 billion this year and could require measures including an increase in income tax, the end of the triple lock on state pension increases and a two-year public sector pay freeze. &gt;The Telegraph can reveal that a Treasury document drawn up for Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, sets out a proposed ""policy package"" of tax increases and spending reductions which may have to be announced within weeks in order to ""enhance credibility and boost investor confidence"" in the British economy. &gt;The document, dated May 5 and marked ""Official – market sensitive"", reveals that the ""base case scenario"" now forecasts that Britain will have a £337 billion budget deficit this year, compared to the forecast £55 billion in March's Budget. &gt;It says tax rises and spending cuts which would raise between £25 billion and £30 billion – equivalent to a 5p increase in the basic rate of income tax – would be needed to fund the increased debt, and presents Mr Sunak with a menu of proposed measures to make up the shortfall. &gt;In the worst case scenario – a so-called ""L-shaped economic decline"" – the figure would increase to a £516 billion deficit in the current financial year, rising to a cumulative £1.19 trillion over five years. This would require up to £90 billion in annual tax rises and/or spending cuts over the next few years. &gt;Even the best-case V-shaped scenario, in which the economy falls sharply but recovers equally quickly – described as ""optimistic"" in the document – would lead to a £209 billion deficit this year. &gt;The disclosure of the bleak economic predictions, which would suggest that Britain's finances are in their weakest state since the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, helps explain why the Government is now urging people to return to work where possible. &gt;On Sunday evening, Boris Johnson set out the country's strategy for beginning to exit the lockdown but was criticised by trade unions and opposition MPs for apparently rushing the return to work. &gt;The Treasury document warns ministers that, if Britain's economy does not recover soon, the country could be thrown into a 1976-style ""sovereign debt crisis"", a situation that led to an international bailout. &gt;On Tuesday, the Chancellor announced that the furlough scheme to subsidise wages would be extended until October but that employers would have to pick up more of the bill from the end of July. &gt;The scheme is now estimated to cost £100 billion, with almost 10 million workers now either paid by the Government-funded initiative or by universal credit. &gt;Mr Sunak is advised that, to ""stabilise debts"" in the base case scenario, he will have to increase taxes or cut spending to raise between £25 billion and £30 billion a year. &gt;In the worst case scenario, he will have to raise £80 billion to £90 billion a year. He is advised that an announcement on how to fund the huge increase in spending may have to be made imminently, but that the tax and spend changes could be delayed to avoid derailing an economic recovery. &gt;The document says the Chancellor ""has indicated a preference for accepting a higher but broadly stable level of debt"" after the crisis. However, it adds: ""As debt is likely to reach significantly higher levels after the crisis, it will be important to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio and prevent debt from continuing to grow on an unsustainable trajectory."" &gt;The document advises Mr Sunak that it is now likely to become necessary to break at least one of the Conservatives' key manifesto pledges not to increase taxes or scrap the triple lock on state pension rises. &gt;It states: ""To fill a gap this size [in the public finances] through tax revenue risers would be very challenging without breaking the tax lock. To raise fiscally significant amounts, we would either have to increase rates/thresholds in one of the broad-based taxes (IT, NICS, VAT, CT) or reform one of the biggest tax reliefs (eg pensions tax)."" &gt;It adds that it would be ""economically better to break the tax lock to achieve revenue of this scale than attempt to raise this level of revenue"" and would also be ""important to consider measures that support a growth-friendly composition of tax (consumption/property taxes rather than taxes on income/profits). &gt;""We should also look at opportunities for new taxes that could meet some of the Government's broader policy objectives, raising revenue to relieve long-term fiscal pressures (eg an NHS/social care surcharge or new carbon/green taxes). A 1 per cent increase in the basic rate in the basic rate of income tax would raise around £5 billion p.a."" &gt;Mr Sunak is also advised that there are ""further options to address the challenge through spending and welfare"" reductions. &gt;The document suggests a two-year freeze on public sector pay could generate savings of £6.5 billion by 2023-24 while ""stopping the rising cost"" of the pension triple lock would produce savings of £8 billion a year. &gt;Officials have also been asked to provide advice on the timing of an announcement, which could take the form of a summer Budget. The document advises the Chancellor that the ""timing, pace and composition of any consolidation should be managed carefully to avoid the risk of stifling the economic recovery"". &gt;However, it adds: ""The timing of an effective medium-term strategy should also take into the account the right time to use political capital, and there may be benefits to setting out future consolidation plans now alongside support for the recovery."" &gt;The document, drawn up by the Chancellor's policy advisers, says ""a more realistic scenario"" than the idea of a V-shaped recovery is a ""prolonged recovery and some permanent damage to the economy"" – in other words, a U-shaped recovery. &gt;In the Treasury's own worst case prediction, the economy would go through an ""L-shaped"" recovery, meaning economic output would remain below current forecasts for the next five years, leading to a large structural deficit and a budget deficit running to one third of GDP. &gt;Mr Sunak has faced repeated questions about how he intends to recoup the cost of the coronavirus bailout package, but has so far refused to be drawn into discussions about future tax rises or squeezes on public spending. &gt;A Treasury source described the measures set out in the document as ""a summary of all the existing levers"" rather than a recommendation of any particular course of action, and said no decisions had yet been made about revenue-raising policies. &gt;The document reveals that the Treasury's own base case scenario – in other words, what it thinks is most likely – estimates that the current budget deficit, forecast at £55 billion for 2020-21 before the pandemic, will actually be £337 billion because of the cost of bailouts and lost tax revenues. The base case puts the deficit at £83 billion in 2021-22, dropping to £32 billion by 2024-25. &gt;In a worst case scenario it will be £516 billion, or £450 billion more than pre-pandemic forecasts. That dwarfs the budget for NHS England, which stands at £129 billion. &gt;The most optimistic scenario given by Treasury advisers is that the deficit will run to £209 billion in the current financial year and could even return to surplus by 2023-24. &gt;A Treasury spokesman said: ""The Government's focus is on supporting families and businesses through this difficult period. That's why we announced an extension to the furlough scheme, which has already saved millions of jobs, earlier.""",1589323618,fqfesy3,t3_gimagz,7,unitedkingdom,1250

"I'm saying that if this were a wide scale problem, that secondary teachers could be relocated. I don't know how it could be done. Maybe it'd be a government system. Maybe the schools would work it out amount themselves. The shift could be lessened by having the primary teachers focus on the younger groups and just have secondaries take over year 6. It's only a year off the age group that they could be teaching anyway. I did some (really) quick research into it and I can't see an issue with qualifications. It looks like there is a specific course for under 5s (EYTS), but primary and secondary share the same base teaching qualification. &gt;D2. Is it possible to teach in primary schools if you have trained in secondary (and vice versa?) &gt; &gt;Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is required to teach in any maintained school (or non-maintained special school) in England; but in theory it is possible with QTS to teach any age range (5-16) and subject. In practice, it is for each school to decide whether an individual has sufficient subject knowledge or experience of the age group to be appointed to any specific position. It may be more feasible in areas with recruitment difficulties and/or in shortage subjects, and undertaking additional subject study may improve the chances. [https://www.abdn.ac.uk/careers/resources/documents/4456.pdf](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/careers/resources/documents/4456.pdf) It looks like the QTS is mandatory and every other standard is set on a case by case basis.

"&gt; So make people redundant and go on universal credit so they have no expendable cash and no taxable income? Okay? What is your point? If business's aren't viable these people are unemployed, that is the reality. You can't just magic an economic downturn away as much as people are trying. That isn't reality. You can mitigate, plan, and give people options. But facts are a lot of people aren't going back to work, there isn't any work for them to do. &gt;Redundancies costs businesses and it puts them in a hard position if there is no work due to the lockdown. They cost them less than holding onto workers doing nothing, and they don't cost much at all for workers under 5 years of services, under 2 years they cost nothing. &gt;Without the furlough the company would have had to make redundancies straight away and eat up a lot of cash paying wages for people they hope to need going forward. Yes it would? What is your point? You can't just pay every zombie businesses complete wage bill forever. The business is either viable or it isn't, if it isn't, make workers redundant and let them move into areas where there is demand. Then make demand, because there is no demand. People aren't keeping their job for the sake of it, that is just stupid and propping up said business is a terrible idea economically. No one has ever claimed there was anything wrong with furloughing people short term. But once people are going back to work, if their job isn't there any more because there is no demand, that is that. If that can be predicted pre-going back to work, an intelligent business would make people redundant sooner rather than later. Businesses certainly aren't in the business of having valueless expenditure, especially in a downturn. &gt;Anyhow the benefit of UBI in terms of boosting the economy comes from the mid to high earners not those unemployed or on the poverty line. For those already earning enough to live comfortably it's disposable cash and boosts the economy. For everyone else it just allows them to live with the basics. No it doesn't. High earners get taxed and end up paying for it. They just can't whine that poor people are getting a hand out because they are getting the same hand out. It works by paying poor people money, they then spend this money in local businesses and then it all comes back in taxation. Poor people generally immediately spend all there money and can't afford to save it, this means it immediately starts to be pulled back by taxation and can then be redistributed again. The economy will collapse if everyone decides it is time to save for a rainy day, it is very much a Ponzi scheme, which is why the government is trying to stop the rug being pulled out from it. UBI is basically irrelevant to high earners as they would be better off not paying for it, the taxation to them means they end up with less money than if they just kept theirs. The advantages come from the basically zero bureaucracy and idiots not being able to whine because everyone gets the same amount of money. If someone else is a scrounger, so are they. &gt;Right now if your not in one of the businesses that's thriving from the lockdown or furloughed your likely on reduced pay and/or hours (I'm on 80% hours/pay). No it wouldn't, and many people are still working, I am, most of my friends are. Have a laptop and you could work from anywhere in the world. The question is of productivity, it is most likely vastly reduced. Also if you work for a decent company and are skilled they will most likely be topping up your salary so you don't go get another job. &gt;So less expendable cash which UBI would counter until things start to recover within businesses. Once again, UBI isn't a magic money tree, it is paid through taxation. High and medium earnings will not be better off from it directly.",1589323121,fqfdt6l,t1_fqfa97d,1,unitedkingdom,686

Ah. I see. You are big on Science. So you know that Economics is pseudoscience. &gt; 1) The furlough proportion cannot be applied to GDP directly. Yes it can. It is a matter of how much accuracy and precision you require in formulating your initial hypothesis. &gt; 2) Russia has 144 million, Canada has 38 million, the UK has 67 million. Yes. This is a *non sequiter*. Unless you do something with it, you are literally making no contribution. Are you saying that I should normalise the numbers or that I should investigate the Gini Coefficient? What? What are you trying to say with this. Because it appears you are saying nothing. &gt; 3) Life experience is not straightforwardly linked to GDP depending on distribution. This is gobbledegook. I know that life experience is not linked to GDP. GDP is a metric from pseudoscience, life experience is what people have. GDP is *derived from* life experience. Life experience is actually far more important than GDP. &gt; 4) You failed to divide the number by capita. No. No I did not. There is, quite literally, no obligation to divide the number by capita in order to form an initial hypothesis. *None at all*. In fact it is often not to do the *standard things* because then you can examine all of your assumptions without committing to them prematurely. &gt; Do you understand now?

"So make people redundant and go on universal credit so they have no expendable cash and no taxable income? Redundancies costs businesses and it puts them in a hard position if there is no work due to the lockdown. Make immediate cuts, put people on unpaid leave or have people being paid to do nothing. Where I work put over 90% of the staff on furlough as the demand dropped to barely above zero. Over the last two weeks it's dropped to around 80-85% furloughed with it slowly getting better. Without the furlough the company would have had to make redundancies straight away and eat up a lot of cash paying wages for people they hope to need going forward. A lot of businesses are going to go bust with this, but a hell of a lot more would go without something like furlough. Yes invest in the future, but without businesses still existing doesn't matter how well someone is trained if the job isn't there. Investing in the future and furlough aren't mutual exclusive. Anyhow the benefit of UBI in terms of boosting the economy comes from the mid to high earners not those unemployed or on the poverty line. For those already earning enough to live comfortably it's disposable cash and boosts the economy. For everyone else it just allows them to live with the basics. Right now if your not in one of the businesses that's thriving from the lockdown or furloughed your likely on reduced pay and/or hours (I'm on 80% hours/pay).

"I agree with you 100% and am grateful to you for having worded this so concisely yet simply (cog-fog is a real b*#%h). The problem is that COVID-19 is so new to the greater bulk of the world population that there is very little immunity, let alone herd immunity. Hopefully this will change; hopefully we will be able to create a protocol that allows us to slow the replication of the virus and also a vaccine. The 20,000 influenza deaths are genuinely unavoidable, they happen even with treatment protocols and antiviral medications, even though humans have herd immunity from it, even though most everyone has natural (vs. acquired) immunity because they themselves have had it at some point in their lives. As sad as it is, that 20,000 is going to happen regardless. I'm in no way making light of the loss of life or pain experienced in relation to those deaths but the thing that people should be focused on regarding that number (with regard to COVID-19) is that we should be hoping that we don't have the same proportion of death with COVID-19 once the pandemic passes. I'm part of the at-risk population - I have multiple sclerosis, Graves Disease and Ehlers-Danlos (aka a bunch of autoimmune disorders). If I were to ignore social distancing and were to get COVID-19, I run the risk not only of a coronavirus infection but also of triggering a flare-up/relapse of any of the diseases that I have, which could be equally dangerous. The same is true for my boyfriend and my family; they are participating in distancing as a means of protecting me. I am also anxious to get the economy back to a level that is functional for not just the rich (especially since that sure as hell doesn't include me), but I also grasp that it is something that is - unfortunately - going to take time. Can we afford to wait for a vaccine?- probably not. But that's not a good argument to just go back to the way things were. Instead, people who are able to survive an infection need to get infected (and survive) but they need to do so in a way that doesn't risk overrunning the hospitals or our supply of equipment. Right now, as I see it, the best way to get to that functional state is to increase testing and implement controlled infections (think pox parties). So you get tested, stay isolated until you get the results, and afterwards, if you have no immunity, you can opt to be infected (so that you can get it out of the way/build immunity that will contribute to the herd immunity), and if you choose to do that, go somewhere where you can be infected but also be observed in case things get crazy (remember that we still have no real way of knowing who will get hit how hard, so this would have to happen in batches so as not to overwhelm the healthcare system). Once you've got immunity, return to work. Repeat throughout the population until the majority is inoculated against the coronavirus. And yes, people will still have to participate in some degree of mitigation between now and herd immunity, but the world has already changed, and a lot of the changes are going to stick no matter what. We need to try to adapt instead of just being pissed that things aren't going to be the same. Just my two cents... “¯\_(ツ)_/¯“",1589320961,fqf9h23,t1_fqezlln,1,unitedkingdom,581

"...Yes, I have thought this through. It only takes reading a few of these comment chains to see exactly how much I have thought this through. I recognise that the size of classrooms can vary, but the average UK class size is around 27 students. As far as I know, class room sizes reflect that number. The national guidelines on school buildings state that the total dimensions of teaching areas within the school should be between 2m\^2 per student and 2.2m\^m per student. If you half the number of students, you double the amount of space available. Spread the remaining students out. If you have 10 teachers teaching 300 students you get a class of 30. That's above the average class size in the UK. If half of those student don't return, you've got 10 teachers teaching 150 students. That gives you the government recommended class size. If you've got classrooms that can't fit the full 15 students then move in a smaller group. If you're running low on space or teachers then set up bigger classes somewhere else. Set them up in gyms and halls, exam style. Use teaching assistants, supply teachers, student teachers and if you're still short then call in secondary school teachers. If that won't work then don't have the teachers take the class directly, have teaching assistants take front and have the actual teachers float between multiple classrooms assigning work and answering questions.

"You have to think, a restaurant gets limited by how many people it can seat. Delivery and takeout is only limited by how much you can push out and how fast. If they're hitting there limit, they're exceeding there expectations and probably trying to figure out how to push out more. Restaurants which adapt and adapt fast will come out of this very well. Edit: they're probably hitting the limit as they're offering the full menu rather than simplifying/modifying for delivery/takeout only. Restaurants can offer more as orders tend to be staggered, so less pressure on the cooks which is the bottleneck. When you offer delivery, you can get a lot of orders in the space on a couple of minutes.

Those 20,000 flu deaths are the ones that happen despite widespread vaccination programmes. They're not really 'avoidable'.

This is a once in a hundred year event, a global pandemic of a virus for which there is no vaccine and has a relatively high mortality rate.

On the other hand, it'll be pretty enraging if old-age care is nationalised and brought up to scratch just in time to accommodate the generation that has taken from younger generations all their lives. Yet another fucking advantage they'll get despite pulling up every damn ladder they can find. They surely can't expect to deny younger generations all the advantages they had and then expect them to pay towards massive improvements to their care that they denied the generations before them.
